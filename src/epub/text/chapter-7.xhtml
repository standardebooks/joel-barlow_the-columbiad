				<span>Thus view’d the Pair; when lo, in eastern skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From glooms unfolding, Gallia’s coasts arise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright o’er the scenes of state a golden throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instarr’d with gems and hung with purple shone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young Bourbon there in royal splendor sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fleets and moving armies round him wait.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the contest, with increased alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill’d every court and roused the world to arms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Hesper’s hand, that light from darkness brings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And good to nations from the scourge of kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this dread hour bade broader beams unfold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the new world illuminate the old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In Europe’s realms a school of sages trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The expanding dawn that waits the reasoning race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bright Occident they fix their eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through glorious toils where struggling nations rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where each firm deed, each new illustrious name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls into light a field of nobler fame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A field that feeds their hope, confirms the plan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of well poised freedom and the weal of man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They scheme, they theorize, expand their scope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glance o’er Hesperia to her utmost cope;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where streams unknown for other oceans stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where suns unseen their waste of beams display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where sires of unborn nations claim their birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask their empires in those wilds of earth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While round all eastern climes, with painful eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In slavery sunk they see the kingdoms lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole states exhausted to enrich a throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their fruits untasted and their rights unknown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through tears of grief, that speak the well taught mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hail the era that relieves mankind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of these the first, the Gallic sages stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And urge their king to lift an aiding hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cause of humankind their souls inspired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbia’s wrongs their indignation fired;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To share her fateful deeds their counsel moved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To base in practice what in theme they proved:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no proud privilege from birth can spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No right divine nor compact<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a> form a king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in the people dwells the sovereign sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who rule by proxy, by themselves obey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That virtues, talents are the test of awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Equal Rights the only source of law.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surrounding heroes wait the monarch’s word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In foreign fields to draw the patriot sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prepared with joy to join those infant powers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who build republics on the western shores.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By honest guile the royal ear they bend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lure him on, blest freedom to defend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, once recognised, once establisht there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world might learn her proffer’d boon to share.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But artful arguments their plan disguise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Garb’d in the gloss that suits a monarch’s eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By arms to humble Britain’s haughty power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her to sever that extended shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contents his utmost wish. For this he lends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His powerful aid and calls the opprest his friends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The league proposed, he lifts his arm to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And speaks the borrow’d language of the brave:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye states of France, and ye of rising name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who work those distant miracles of fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear and attend; let heaven the witness bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We wed the cause, we join the righteous war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let leagues eternal bind each friendly land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Given by our voice and stablisht by our hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let that brave people fix their infant sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spread their blessings with the bounds of day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet know, ye nations, hear ye Powers above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our purposed aid no views of conquest move;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that young world revives no ancient claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of regions peopled by the Gallic name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our envied bounds, already stretcht afar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ask the sword nor fear encroaching war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But virtue, coping with the tyrant power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That drenches earth in her best children’s gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With nature’s foes bids former compact cease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We war reluctant and our wish is peace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For man’s whole race the sword of France we draw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is our will, and let our will be law.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke; his moving armies veil’d the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His fleets rode bounding on the western main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er lands and seas the loud applauses rung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And war and union dwelt on every tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other Bourbon caught the splendid strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Gallia’s arms he joins the powers of Spain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sails assemble; Crillon lifts the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Minorca bows and owns her ancient lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But while dread Elliott<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-44" id="noteref-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a> shakes the Midland wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They strive in vain the Calpian rock to brave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Batavia’s states with equal speed prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through western isles to meet the naval war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Albion there rakes rude the tortured main</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And foils the force of Holland, France and Spain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where old Indostan still perfumes the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To furious strife his ardent myriads rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierce Hyder there, unconquerably bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bids a new flag its horned moons unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spreads o’er Carnatic kings his splendid force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And checks the Britons in their waiting course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Europe’s pacific powers their counsels join,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The laws of trade to settle and define.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The imperial Moscovite around him draws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each Baltic state to join the righteous cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose arm’d Neutrality the way prepares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To check the ravages of future wars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till by degrees the wasting sword shall cease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And commerce lead to universal peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus all the ancient world with anxious eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enjoy the lights that gild Atlantic skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wake to new life, assume a borrow’d flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enlarge the lustre and partake the fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So mounts of ice, that polar heavens invade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though piled unseen through night’s long wintry shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When morn at last illumes their glaring throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give back the day and imitate the sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But still Columbus, on his war-beat shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees Albion’s fleets her new battalions pour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The states unconquer’d still their terrors wield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stain with mingled gore the embattled field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Pennsylvania’s various plains they move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And adverse armies equal slaughter prove;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbia mourns her Nash in combat slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Britons around him press the gory plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skirmish and cannonade and distant fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each power diminish and each nation tire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Howe from fruitless toil demands repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leaves despairing in a land of foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wearied host; who now, to reach their fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Jersey hills commence their long retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tread back the steps their chief had led before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask in vain the late abandon’d shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Hudson meets the main; for on their rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbia moves and checks their swift career.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But where green Monmouth lifts his grassy height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They halt, they face, they dare the coming fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howe’s proud successor, Clinton, hosting there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tempt once more the desperate chance of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Towers at their head, in hopes to work relief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mend the errors of his former chief.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here shines his day; and here with loud acclaim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Begins and ends his little task of fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He vaults before them with his balanced blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheels the bright van and forms the long parade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Britons, Hessians crowd the glittering field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all their powers for ready combat wield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the dim sun, beneath the skirts of even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crimsons the clouds that sail the western heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, in red wavy rows where spread the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of men and standards, shone the fateful plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They shone, till Washington obscured their light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his long ranks roll’d forward to the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He points the charge; the mounted thunders roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rake the champaign to the distant shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the folds of smoke that veil the war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His guiding sword illumes the fields of air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vollied flames, bright bursting o’er the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break the brown clouds discovering far the slain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till flight begins; the smoke is roll’d away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the red standards open into day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Britons and Germans hurry from the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now wrapt in dust and now to sight reveal’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind, swift Washington his falchion drives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thins the pale ranks, but saves submissive lives.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hosts captive bow and move behind his arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hosts before him wing the sounding storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the glad sea salutes their fainting sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Albion’s fleet wide thundering aids their flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They steer to sad New York their hasty way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rue the toils of Monmouth’s mournful day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Hudson still, with his interior tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laves a rude rock that bears Britannia’s pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swells round the headland with indignant roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mocks her thunders from his murmuring shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a firm cohort starts from Peekskill plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crush the invaders and the post regain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, gallant Hull, again thy sword is tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meigs, Fleury, Butler, laboring side by side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wayne takes the guidance, culls the vigorous band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes out the flint, and bids the nervous hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trust the mute bayonet and midnight skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stretch o’er craggy walls the dark surprise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With axes, handspikes on the shoulder hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sly watchword whisper’d from the tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through different paths the silent march they take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plunge, climb the ditch, the palisado break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Secure each sentinel, each picket shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grope the dim postern where the byways run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon the roused garrison perceives its plight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Small time to rally and no means of flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They spring confused to every post they know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point their poised cannon where they hear the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streak the dark welkin with the flames they pour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rock the mountain with convulsive roar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The swift assailants still no fire return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, tow’rd the batteries that above them burn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climb hard from crag to crag; and scaling higher</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They pierce the long dense canopy of fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sheeted all the sky; then rush amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Storm every outwork, each dread summit gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hew timber’d gates, the sullen drawbridge fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>File through and form within the sounding wall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Britons strike their flag, the fort forgo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descend sad prisoners to the plain below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand veterans, ere the morning rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Received their handcuffs from five hundred foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Stonypoint beheld, with dawning day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own starr’d standard on his rampart play.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From sackt Savannah, whelm’d in hostile fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A few raw troops brave Lincoln now retires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rapid march to suffering Charleston goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To meet the myriads of concentring foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who shade the pointed strand. Each fluvial flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their gathering fleets and floating batteries load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close their black sails, debark the amphibious host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with their moony anchors fang the coast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bold beleaguer’d post the hero gains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the hard siege with various fate sustains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cornwallis, towering at the British van,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these fierce toils his wild career began;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He mounts the forky streams and soon bestrides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The narrow neck that parts converging tides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sinks the deep trench, erects the mantling tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lines with strong forts the desolated shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hems on all sides the long unsuccour’d place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With mines and parallels contracts the space;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then bids the battering floats his labors crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pour their bombard on the shuddering town.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High from the decks the mortar’s bursting fires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweep the full streets, and splinter down the spires.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blaze-trailing fuses vault the night’s dim round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shells and langrage lacerate the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the tented plain, where heroes tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is torn with crags and cover’d with the dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each shower of flames renews the townsmen’s woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They wail the fight, they dread the cruel foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Matrons in crowds, while tears bedew their charms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Babes at their sides and infants in their arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Press round their Lincoln and his hand implore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save them trembling from the tyrant’s power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shares their anguish with a moistening eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bids the balls rain thicker through the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tries every aid that art and valor yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sap, the countermine, the battling field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bold sortie, by famine urged afar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That dreadful daughter of earth-wasting War.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But vain the conflict now; on all the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foes in fresh brigades around him pour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He yields at last the well contested prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And freedom’s banners quit the southern skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The victor Britons soon the champaign tread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And far anorth their fire and slaughter spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through fortless realms, where unarm’d peasants fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cornwallis bears his bloody standard high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Carolina rolls his growing force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thousands fall and thousands aid his course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in his march athwart the wide domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Colonial dastards join his splendid train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So mountain streams through slopes of melting snow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swell their foul waves and flood the world below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Awhile the Patriarch saw, with heaving sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These crimson flags insult the saddening skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw desolation whelm his favorite coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His children scattered and their vigor lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dekalb in furious combat press the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Morgan and Smallwood every shock sustain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gates, now no more triumphant, quit the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant Davidson his lifeblood yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blount, Gregory, Williamson, with souls of fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But slender force, from hill to hill retire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Greene in lonely greatness takes the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bids at last the trump of vengeance sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A few firm patriots to the chief repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raise the star standard and demand the war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But o’er the regions as he turns his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What foes develop! and what forts arise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rawdon with rapid marches leads their course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From state to state Cornwallis whirls their force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impetuous Tarleton like a torrent pours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fresh battalions land along the shores;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where now resurgent from his captive chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Phillips wide storming shakes the field again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And traitor Arnold, lured by plunder o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joins the proud powers his valor foil’d before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Greene views the tempest with collected soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fates of empires in his bosom roll;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So small his force, where shall he lift the steel?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Superior hosts o’er every canton wheel)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how behold their wanton carnage spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself stand idle and his country bleed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt in a moment’s pause the general stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And held his warriors from the field of blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then points the British legions where to steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marks to their chief a rapid wild career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide o’er Virginia lets him foeless roam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To search for pillage and to find his doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With short-lived glory feeds his sateless flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But leaves the victory to a nobler name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives to great Washington to meet his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor claims the honors of so bright a day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now to the conquer’d south he turns his force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Renerves the nation by his rapid course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forts fall around him, hosts before him fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And captive bands his growing train supply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred leagues of coast, in one campaign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return reconquer’d to their lords again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last Britannia’s vanguard, near the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veers on her foe to make one vigorous stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her gallant Stuart here amass’d from far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The veteran legions of the Georgian war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid her hard-pusht powers, and quick restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The British name to that extended shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He checks their flight, and chooses well their field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flank’d with a marsh, by lofty woods concealed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Eutaw’s fountains, tinged of old with gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still murmuring swell’d amid the bones they bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Destined again to foul their pebbly stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mournful monuments of human fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There Albion’s columns ranged in order bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand like a fiery wall and wait the shock of fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Swift on the neighboring hill as Greene arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He view’d, with rapid glance the glittering foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disposed for combat all his ardent train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To charge, change front, each echelon sustain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roused well their rage superior force to prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waved his bright blade and bade the onset move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As hovering clouds, when morning beams arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang their red curtains round our eastern skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfold a space to hail the promised sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And catch their splendors from his rising throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus glow’d the opposing fronts, whose steely glare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced o’er the shuddering interval of war.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From Albion’s left the cannonade began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pour’d thick thunders on Hesperia’s van,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forced in her dexter guards, that skirmisht wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prove what powers the forest hills might hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They break, fall back, with measured quickstep tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Form close, and flank the solid squares they led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now roll, with kindling haste, the long stark lines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From wing to wing the sounding battle joins;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Batteries and field-parks and platoons of fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mingled shocks their roaring blasts expire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each front approaching fast, with equal pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Devours undaunted their dividing space;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, dark beneath the smoke, the meeting ranks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slope their strong bayonets, with short firm shanks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Protruded from their tubes; each bristling van,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steel fronting steel, and man encountering man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dreadful silence tread. As, wrapt from sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nightly ambush moves to secret fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So rush the raging files and sightless close</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In plunging thrust with fierce conflicting foes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They reach, they strike, they stagger o’er the slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deal doubtful blows or closing clench their man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intwine their twisting limbs, the gun forgo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrench off the bayonet and dirk the foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then struggling back reseize the musket bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Club the broad breech and headlong whirl to war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranks crush on ranks, with equal slaughter gored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warm dripping streams from every lifted sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stain the thin carnaged corps; who still maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With mutual shocks, the vengeance of the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last where Williams fought and Campbell fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwonted strokes the British line repel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rout begins; the shattered wings afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll back in haste and scatter from the war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They drop their arms, they scour the marshy field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole squadrons fall and faint battalions yield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The great observer, fixt in his midsky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>View’d the whole combat, saw them fall and fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He markt where Greene with every onset drove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw death and victory with his presence move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath his arm saw Marion, Sumter, Gaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pickens and Sumner shake the astonisht plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw young Washington, the child of fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Preserve in fight the honors of his name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lee, Jackson, Hampton, Pinckney, matcht in might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll’d on the storm and hurried fast the flight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While numerous chiefs, that equal trophies raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought, not unseen, the deeds of deathless praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Europe now the newborn states beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shock sustain of many a hard fought field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift o’er the main, with high-spread sails advance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our brave auxiliars from the coast of France.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the tall decks their curious chiefs explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With optic tube, our camp-encumber’d shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as the lessening wave behind them flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide scenes of conflict open on their eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rochambeau foremost with his gleamy brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Points to each field and singles every band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees Washington the power of nations guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And longs to toil and conquer by his side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two brother chiefs, Viominil the name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brothers in birth but twins in generous fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold with steadfast eye the plains disclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uncase their arms and claim the promised foes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Biron, beneath his sail, in armor bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frown’d o’er the wave impatient for the fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fiery steed beside the hero stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his blue blade waved forward o’er the crowd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With eager haste descending on the coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the glad states they march their veteran host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From sea-nursed Newport file o’er western roads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitch many a camp and bridge a hundred floods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass the full towns, where joyful crowds admire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their foreign speech, gay mien and gilt attire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Applaud their generous deeds, the zeal that draws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their swords untried in freedom’s doubtful cause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Hartford plains, on Litchfield hills they gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wave their white flags o’er Hudson’s loaded stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Band after band with Delaware’s current pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shade Schuylkill’s wave and Elk’s indented shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Join their new friends where allied banners lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Demand the foe and bid the war proceed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again Columbus turn’d his anxious eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Britain’s banner waved along the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, graced with spoils of many fields of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cornwallis boastful on a bulwark stood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where York and Gloster’s rocky towers bestride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their parent stream, Virginia’s midmost tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He camp’d his hundred nations to regain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their force, exhausted in the long campaign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paused for a moment on a scene so vast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To plan the future and review the past.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through vanquisht provinces and towns in flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He mark’d his recent monuments of fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His checker’d marches, long and various toils</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And camp well stored with wide collected spoils.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High glittering to the sun his hands unfold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A map new drafted on a sheet of gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in delusive haste his burin graved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A country conquer’d and a race enslaved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its middle realm, by fairer figures known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rich with fruits, lay bounded for his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep through the centre spreads a branching bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full sails ascend and golden rivers stray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright palaces arise relieved in gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gates and streets the crossing lines unfold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>James furrows o’er the plate with turgid tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young Richmond roughens on his masted side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reviving Norfolk from her ashes springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A golden phoenix on refulgent wings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Potomac’s yellow waves reluctant spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Vernon rears his rich and radiant head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis here the chief his pointed graver stays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bank to burnish with a purer blaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives all his art, on this bright hill to trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His future seat and glory of his race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deems his long line of lords the realm shall own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kings predestined to Columbia’s throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But while his mind thus quafft its airy food,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gazing thousands round the rampart stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom future ease and golden dreams employ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The songs of triumph and the feast of joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sudden great Washington arose in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And allied flags his stately steps pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaul’s veteran host and young Hesperia’s pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bend the long march concentring at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stream over Chesapeake, like sheets of flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drive tempestuous to the field of fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far on the wild expanse, where ocean lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scorns all confines but incumbent skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorns to retain the imprinted paths of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To guide their wanderings or direct their ken;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where warring vagrants, raging as they go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask of the stars their way to find the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbus saw two hovering fleets advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rival ensigns o’er their pinions dance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graves, on the north, with Albion’s flag unfurl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waves proud defiance to the naval world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Degrasse, from southern isles, conducts his train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shades with Gallic sheets the moving main.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Morn, unconscious of the coming fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That soon shall storm the crystal cope of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glows o’er the heavens and with her orient breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fans her fair face and curls the summer seas.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The swelling sails, as far as eye can sweep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look through the skies and awe the shadowy deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead their long bending lines; and, ere they close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To count, recognise, circumvent their foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each hauls his wind, the weathergage to gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And master all the movements of the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or bears before the breeze with loftier gait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, beam to beam, begins the work of fate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when the warring winds, from each far pole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their adverse storms across the concave roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thin fleecy vapors through the expansion run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veil the blue vault and tremble o’er the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the dark folding wings together drive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, ridged with fire and rockt with thunder, strive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, hazing through the void, at first appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White clouds of canvass floating on the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then frown the broad black decks, the sails are stay’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gaping portholes cast a frightful shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flames triple tier’d and tides of smoke arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fulminations rock the seas and skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From van to rear the roaring deluge runs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The storm disgorging from a thousand guns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each like a vast volcano, spouting wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hissing hell-dogs o’er the shuddering tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirls high his chainshot, cleaves the mast and strows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shiver’d fragments on the staggering foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose gunwale sides with iron globes are gored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a wild storm of splinters sweeps the board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Husht are the winds of heaven; no more the gale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks the red rolls of smoke nor flaps the sail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dark dead calm continuous cloaks the glare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And holds the clouds of sulphur on the war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Convolving o’er the space that yawns and shines</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With frequent flash between the laboring lines.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor sun nor sea nor skyborn lightning gleams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But flaming Phlegethon’s asphaltic steams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streak the long gaping gulf; where varying glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carbonic curls above, blue flakes of fire below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hither two hostile ships to contact run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both grappling, board to board and gun to gun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each through the adverse ports their contents pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rake the lower decks, the interior timbers bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive into chinks the illumined wads unseen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose flames approach the unguarded magazine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above, with shrouds afoul and gunwales mann’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick halberds clash; and, closing hand to hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The huddling troops infuriate from despair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tug at the toils of death, and perish there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grenados, carcasses their fragments spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pikes and pistols strow the decks with dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now on the Gallic board the Britons rush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The intrepid Gauls the rash adventurers crush;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now, to vengeance stung, with frantic air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back on the British maindeck roll the war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There swells the carnage; all the tar-beat floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is clogg’d with spatter’d brains and glued with gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the ship’s black waist, fresh brooks of blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Course o’er their clots and tinge the sable flood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till War, impatient of the lingering strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That tires and slackens with the waste of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opes with engulfing gape the astonisht wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whelms the combat whole, in one vast grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the chamber’d powder caught the flames</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into atoms whirl’d the monstrous frames</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of both the entangled ships; the vortex wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roars like an Etna through the belching tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blazing into heaven and bursting high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shells, carriages and guns obstruct the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cords, timbers, trunks of men the welkin sweep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fall on distant ships or shower along the deep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The matcht armadas still the fight maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But cautious, distant; lest the staggering main</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive their whole lines afoul, and one dark day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glut the proud ocean with too rich a prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last, where scattering fires the cloud disclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hulls heave in sight and blood the decks o’erflows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here from the field tost navies rise to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive back to vengeance and the roar renew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There shatter’d ships commence their flight afar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tow’d through the smoke, hard struggling from the war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some, half seen amid the gaping wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plunge in the whirl they make and gorge their grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon the dark smoky volumes roll’d away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a long line ascended into day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pinions swell’d, Britannia’s cross arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flew the terrors of triumphing foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When to Virginia’s bay, new shocks to brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Gallic powers their conquering banners wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glad Chesapeake unfolds his bosom wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leads their prows to York’s contracting tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where still dread Washington directs his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seas and continents his voice obey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While brave Cornwallis, mid the gathering host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perceives his glories gone, his promised empire lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Columbus here with silent joy beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His favorite sons the fates of nations wield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here joyous Lincoln rose in arms again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nelson and Knox moved ardent o’er the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scammel alert with force unusual trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prepared to seal their victory with his blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cobb, Dearborn, Laurens, Tilghman, green in years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ripe in glory, tower’d amid their peers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death daring Hamilton with splendor shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And claim’d each post of danger for his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skill’d every arm in war’s whole hell to wield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An Ithacus in camp, an Ajax in the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their Gallic friends an equal ardor fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brisk emulation every troop inspires:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Tarleton turns, with hopes of flight elate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave Biron moves and drives him back to fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hems in his host, to wait, on Gloster plains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their finish’d labors and their destined chains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two British forts the growing siege outflank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rake its wide works and awe the tide-beat bank;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift from the lines two chosen bands advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our light arm’d scouts, the grenadiers of France;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These young Viominil conducts to fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those Fayette’s unerring guidance claim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No cramm’d cartouch their belted back attires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No grains of sleeping thunder wait their fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flint, the ramrod spurn’d away they cast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strong bright bayonet, imbeaded fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands beaming from the bore; with this they tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor heed from high-wall’d foes their showers of lead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each rival band, though wide and distant far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Springs simultaneous to this task of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here a twofold force each hero draws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own proud country and the general cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each with twofold energy contends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His foes to vanquish and outstrip his friends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They summon all their zeal and wild and warm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er flaming ramparts pour the maddening storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mounted cannons crush and lead the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two trains of captives to the plain below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An equal prize each gallant troop ameeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alike their numbers and alike their deeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A strong high citadel still thundering stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stream’d her standard o’er the field of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Checkt long the siege with fulminating blare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorn’d all the steel and every globe of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Defied fell famine, heapt her growing store</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And housed in bombproof all the host she bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No rude assault can stretch the scale so high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vain the battering siege-guns round her ply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mortars well poised their deafening deluge rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Load the red skies and shake the shores in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her huge rock battlements rebound the blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And roll their loose crags on the men below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But while the fusing fireballs scorch the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their mining arts the staunch besiegers ply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delve from the bank of York, and gallery far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep subterranean, to the mount of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the ditch, through rocks and fens they go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scoop the dark chamber plumb beneath the foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There lodge their tons of powder and retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mure the dread passage, wave the fatal fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send a swift messenger to warn the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek his safety and the post forgo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A taunting answer comes; he dares defy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spring the mine and all its Etnas try;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a black miner seized the sulphur’d brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shriekt high for joy and with untrembling hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toucht quick the insidious train; lest here the chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should change his counsel and afford relief:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hard the general’s task to speak the doom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sends a thousand heroes to the tomb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes who know no wrong; who thoughtless speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where kings command or where their captains lead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—Burst with the blast the reeling mountain roars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaves, labors, boils and through the concave pours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His flaming contents high; he chokes the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all his warriors and their works of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guns, bastions, magazines confounded fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vault wide their fresh explosions o’er the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Encumber each far camp and plow profound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their rude fragments every neighboring ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Britain’s brave leader, where he sought repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deem’d his hill-fort still repulsed the foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts at the astounding earthquake and descries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His chosen veterans whirling down the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their mangled members round his balcon fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorcht in the flames and dasht on every wall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad field of contemplation! here, ye great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kings, priests of God, and ministers of state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Review your system here! behold and scan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your own fair deeds, your benefits to man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You will not leave him to his natural toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tame these elements and till the soil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reap, share, tithe you what his hand has sown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enjoy his treasures and increase your own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build up his virtues on the base design’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The well toned harmonies of humankind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You choose to check his toil and band his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all that’s honest and to all that’s wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lure with false fame, false morals and false lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To barter fields of corn for fields of gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take by bands what single thieves would spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And methodise his murders into war.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the prest garrison fresh danger warms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They rush impetuous to each post of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man the long trench, each embrasure sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pour their langrage on the allied train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose swift approaches, crowding on the line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each wing envelop and each front confine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all sage Washington his arm extends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Points every movement, every work defends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bids closer quarters, bloodier strokes proceed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New batteries blaze and heavier squadrons bleed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Line within line fresh parallels enclose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here runs a zigzag, there a mantlet grows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round the pent foe approaching breastworks rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bombs like meteors vault the flaming skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Night, with her hovering wings, asserts in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shades, the silence of her rightful reign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High roars her canopy with fiery flakes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And War stalks wilder through the glare he makes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With dire dismay the British chief beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foe advance, his veterans shun the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Despair and slaughter where he turns his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No hope in combat and no power to fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Degrasse victorious shakes the shadowy tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imbodied nations all the champaign hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fosses and batteries, growing on the sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still pour new thunders and increase the fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shells rain before him, rending every mound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crags, gunstones, balls o’erturn the tented ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From post to post his driven ranks retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The earth in crimson and the skies on fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death wantons proud in this decisive round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here his hand its favorite victim found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave Scammel perisht here. Ah! short, my friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy bright career, but glorious to its end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go join thy Warren’s ghost, your fates compare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His that commenced, with thine that closed the war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom, with laurel’d brow but tearful eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bewails her first and last, her twinlike sacrifice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now grateful truce suspends the burning war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And groans and shouts promiscuous load the air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the tired Britons, where the smokes decay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit their strong station and resign the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slow files along the immeasurable train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thousands on thousands redden all the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furl their torn bandrols, all their plunder yield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pile their muskets on the battle field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wide auxiliar nations swell the crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the coopt navies from the neighboring flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repeat surrendering signals and obey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The landmen’s fate on this concluding day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cornwallis first, their late all-conquering lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bears to the victor chief his conquer’d sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Presents the burnisht hilt and yields with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gift of kings, here brandisht long in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then bow their hundred banners, trailing far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wearied wings from all the skirts of war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Battalion’d infantry and squadron’d horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dash the silk tassel and the golden torse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flags from the forts and ensigns from the fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll in the dust and at Columbia’s feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prostrate the pride of thrones; they firm the base</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of freedom’s temple, while her arms they grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Albion’s crimson Cross the soil o’erspreads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her Lion crouches and her Thistle fades;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant Erin rues her trampled Lyre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brunswick’s pale Steed forgets his foamy fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proud Hessia’s Castle lies in dust o’erthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And venal Anspach quits her broken Crown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long trains of wheel’d artillery shade the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quench their blue matches and forget to roar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the encumber’d plain, thick planted rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High stacks of muskets glittering to the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Numerous and vast. As when the toiling swains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heap their whole harvest on the stubbly plains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gerb after gerb the bearded shock expands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shocks, ranged in rows, hill high the burden’d lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The joyous master numbers all the piles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er his well-earn’d crop complacent smiles:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such growing heaps this iron harvest yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So tread the victors this their final field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Triumphant Washington, with brow serene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regards unmoved the exhilarating scene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weighs in his balanced thought the silent grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sinks the bosom of the fallen chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the joy that laurel crowns bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A world reconquer’d and a vanquisht foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus through extremes of life, in every state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines the clear soul, beyond all fortune great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While smaller minds, the dupes of fickle chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slight woes o’erwhelm and sudden joys entrance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the full sun, through all the changing sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor blasts nor overpowers the naked eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though transient splendors, borrowed from his light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glance on the mirror and destroy the sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He bids brave Lincoln guide with modest air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last glad triumph of the finisht war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sees, once more, two armies shade one plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty victors and the captive train.</span>
