				<span>I sing the Mariner who first unfurl’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An eastern banner o’er the western world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And taught mankind where future empires lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these fair confines of descending day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sway’d a moment, with vicarious power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iberia’s sceptre on the new found shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then saw the paths his virtuous steps had trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pursued by avarice and defiled with blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tribes he foster’d with paternal toil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snatcht from his hand, and slaughter’d for their spoil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaves, kings, adventurers, envious of his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enjoy’d his labours and purloin’d his fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave the Viceroy, from his high seat hurl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chains for a crown, a prison for a world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long overwhelm’d in woes, and sickening there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He met the slow still march of black despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought the last refuge from his hopeless doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wisht from thankless men a peaceful tomb:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till vision’d ages, opening on his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cheer’d his sad soul, and bade new nations rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw the Atlantic heaven with light o’ercast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Freedom crown his glorious work at last.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almighty Freedom! give my venturous song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The force, the charm that to thy voice belong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis thine to shape my course, to light my way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To nerve my country with the patriot lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To teach all men where all their interest lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How rulers may be just and nations wise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong in thy strength I bend no suppliant knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Invoke no miracle, no Muse but thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Night held on old Castile her silent reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her half orb’d moon declining to the main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Valladolid’s regal turrets hazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The drizzly fogs from dull Pisuerga raised;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose hovering sheets, along the welkin driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinn’d the pale stars, and shut the eye from heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold-hearted Ferdinand his pillow prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dream’d of those his mandates robb’d of rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him who gemm’d his crown, who stretcht his reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To realms that weigh’d the tenfold poise of Spain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now beneath his tower indungeon’d fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweats the chill sod and breathes inclement airs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His feverish pulse, slow laboring through his frame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeds with scant force its fast expiring flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A far dim watch-lamp’s thrice reflected beam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws through his grate a mist-encumber’d gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paints the dun vapors that the cell invade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fills with spectred forms the midnight shade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from a visionary short repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That nursed new cares and temper’d keener woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbus woke, and to the walls addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deep felt sorrows bursting from his breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here lies the purchase, here the wretched spoil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of painful years and persevering toil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these damp caves, this hideous haunt of pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I traced new regions o’er the chartless main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tamed all the dangers of untraversed waves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung o’er their clefts, and topt their surging graves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw traitorous seas o’er coral ridges sweep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red thunders rock the pole and scorch the deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death rear his front in every varying form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gape from the shoals and ride the roaring storm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My struggling bark her seamy planks disjoin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rake the rude rock and drink the copious brine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the tired elements are lull’d at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And milder suns allay the billowing blast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead on the trade winds with unvarying force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And long and landless curve our constant course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our homeward heaven recoils; each night forlorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls up new stars, and backward rolls the morn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boreal vault descends with Europe’s shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bright Callisto shuns the wave no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Dragon dips his fiery-foaming jole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The affrighted magnet flies the faithless pole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature portends a general change of laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My daring deeds are deemed the guilty cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The desperate crew, to insurrection driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Devote their captain to the wrath of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resolve at once to end the audacious strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And buy their safety with his forfeit life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that sad hour, this feeble frame to save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Unblest reprieve) and rob the gaping wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The morn broke forth, these tearful orbs descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden banks that bound the western tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With full success I calm’d the clamorous race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bade heaven’s blue arch a second earth embrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave the astonisht age that bounteous shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wealth to nations, and to kings their power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Land of delights! ah, dear delusive coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these fond aged eyes forever lost!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more thy flowery vales I travel o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For me thy mountains rear the head no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For me thy rocks no sparkling gems unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor streams luxuriant wear their paths in gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From realms of promised peace forever borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hail mute anguish, and in secret mourn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But dangers past, a world explored in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And foes triumphant show but half my pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dissembling friends, each early joy who gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fired my youth the storms of fate to brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swarm’d in the sunshine of my happier days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pursued the fortune and partook the praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now pass my cell with smiles of sour disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Insult my woes and triumph in my pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One gentle guardian once could shield the brave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now that guardian slumbers in the grave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear from above, thou dear departed shade!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As then my hopes, so now my sorrows aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burst my full heart, afford that last relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathe back my sighs and reinspire my grief;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still in my sight thy royal form appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reproves my silence and demands my tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even on that hour no more I joy to dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thy protection bade the canvas swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When kings and churchmen found their factions vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When superstition shrunk beneath her chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun’s glad beam led on the circling way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And isles rose beauteous in Atlantic day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For on those silvery shores, that new domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What crowds of tyrants fix their murderous reign!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her infant realm indignant Freedom flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth leaves the world and Isabella dies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, lend thy friendly shroud to veil my sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That these pain’d eyes may dread no more the light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These welcome shades shall close my instant doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this drear mansion moulder to a tomb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus mourn’d the hapless man: a thundering sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll’d through the shuddering walls and shook the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all the dungeon, where black arches bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The roofs unfold and streams of light descend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The growing splendor fills the astonisht room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gales ethereal breathe a glad perfume.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robed in the radiance, moves a form serene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of human structure but of heavenly mien;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near to the prisoner’s couch he takes his stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waves, in sign of peace, his holy hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tall rose his stature, youth’s endearing grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adorn’d his limbs and brighten’d in his face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loose o’er his locks the star of evening hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sounds melodious moved his cheerful tongue:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rise, trembling chief, to scenes of rapture rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This voice awaits thee from the western skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indulge no longer that desponding strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor count thy toils, nor deem thy virtues vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou seest in me the guardian Power who keeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The new found world that skirts Atlantic deeps;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hesper my name, my seat the brightest throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In night’s whole heaven, my sire the living sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brother Atlas, from his birthright boast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claims the wild wave, but mine the solid coast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This hand, which form’d, and in the tides of time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laves and improves the meliorating clime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which taught thy prow to cleave the trackless way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hail’d thee first in occidental day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all thy worth shall vindicate thy claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And raise up nations to revere thy name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In this dark age though blinded faction sways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wealth and conquest gain the palm of praise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awed into slaves while groveling millions groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blood-stain’d steps lead upward to a throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far other wreaths thy virtuous temples twine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far nobler triumphs crown a life like thine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine be the joys that minds immortal grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thine the deeds that bless a kindred race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now raise thy sorrow’d soul to views more bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vision’d ages rushing on thy sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worlds beyond worlds shall bring to light their stores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time, nature, science blend their utmost powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show, concentred in one blaze of fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ungather’d glories that await thy name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As that great seer, whose animating rod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taught Jacob’s sons their wonder-working God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led far through dreary wastes the murmuring band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reacht the confines of their promised land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forbid to enter, but from Pisgah’s height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On fruitful Canaan feasted long his sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>View’d unborn nations from his labors blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgot his toils and sooth’d his soul to rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus o’er thy subject wave shalt thou behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far happier realms their future charms unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In nobler pomp another Pisgah rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath whose foot thy new found Canaan lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There, rapt in vision, hail my favorite clime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And taste the blessings of remotest time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Hesper spoke; Columbus raised his head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His chains dropt off; the cave, the castle fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forth walkt the Pair; when steep before them stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A radiant track, a heaven-illumined road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That through disparting shades arose on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reacht o’er the hills and lengthen’d up the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Show’d a clear summit, rich with rising flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That breathe their odors through celestial bowers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the proud Pyrenees it looks sublime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Subjects the Alps and levels Europe’s clime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spain, lessening to a chart, beneath it swims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrouds her dungeons in the void she dims.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Led by the Power, the Hero gain’d the height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New strength and brilliance flusht his mortal sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When calm before them flow’d the western main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far stretcht, immense, a sky-encircled plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sail, no isle, no cloud invests the bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor billowy surge disturbs the vast profound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, deep in distant heavens, the sun’s blue ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Topt unknown cliffs and call’d them up to day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slow glimmering into sight wide regions drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rose and brighten’d on the expanding view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair sweep the waves, the lessening ocean smiles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In misty radiance loom a thousand isles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near and more near the long drawn coasts arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bays stretch their arms and mountains lift the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lakes unfolding point the streams their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slopes, ridges, plains their spreading skirts display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vales branch forth, high walk approaching groves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the majesty of nature moves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O’er the wild hemisphere his glances fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its form distending as it still draws nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As all its salient sides force far their sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowd back the ocean and indent the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw, through central zones, the winding shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread the deep gulf his sail had traced before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Darien isthmus check the raging tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Join distant lands and neighboring seas divide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On either hand the shores unbounded bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Push wide their waves, to each dim pole ascend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The two twin continents diverging rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad as the main and lengthen’d with the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long gazed the Mariner; when thus the Guide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here spreads the world thy daring sail descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hesperia call’d, from my anterior claim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now Columbia, from thy patriarch name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So from Phoenicia’s peopled strand of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Europa sail’d and sought an unknown shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stampt her sacred name; and thence her race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hale, venturous, bold from Jove’s divine embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranged o’er the world, predestined to bestride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth’s elder continents and each far tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ages unborn shall bless the happier day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That saw thy streamer shape the guideless way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bravest heroes trace the path you led</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sires of nations through the regions spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold yon isles, where first thy flag unfurl’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In bloodless triumph o’er the younger world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As, awed to silence, savage bands gave place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hail’d with joy the sun-descended race.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Retrace the banks yon rushing waters lave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There Orinoco checks great ocean’s wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine is the stream; it cleaves the well known coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Paria’s walks thy former footsteps boast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But these no more thy wide discoveries bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Superior prospects lead their swelling round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature’s remotest scenes before thee roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And years and empires open on thy soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With yon bold eminence commence thy view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See Quito’s plains o’erlook their proud Peru,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On whose huge base, like islands built in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A vast protuberance forms the gates of even.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approaching slow they still expand their bounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The yielding concave bends sublimer rounds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose wearied stars, high curving to the west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pause on the summits for a moment’s rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recumbent there they renovate their force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And roll rejoicing on their downward course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Another mass invades yon southern skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hills form on hills and peaks o’er peaks arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascending, whitening, rocks and crags are lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’erhung with headcliffs of eternal frost!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad fields of ice give back the morning ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like walls of suns or heaven’s perennial day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There folding storms on eastern pinions ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veil the black void and wrap the mountains side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rude thunders rake the crags, the rains descend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the long lightnings o’er the valleys bend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While blasts unburden’d sweep the cliffs of snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whirlwinds wheel above, the floods convolve below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There molten rocks explosive rend their tomb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Volcanos, laboring many a nation’s doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild o’er the regions pour their floods of fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shores heave backward and the seas retire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There lava waits my late reluctant call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To roar aloft and shake some guilty wall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy pride, O Lima, swells the sulphurous wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fanes and priests and idols crowd thy grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But cease, my son, these dread events to trace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor learn the woes that here await thy race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anorth from that broad gulf, where verdant rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those gentler mounds that skirt the temperate skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A happier hemisphere invites thy view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ancient world shall there embrace the new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There Europe’s better sons their seat shall trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And change of government improve the race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all the midsky zones, to yon blue pole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their green hills lengthen, their bright rivers roll;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swelling westward, how their champaigns run!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How slope their uplands to the morning sun!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spoke the blest Immortal; when more near</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His northern wilds in all their breadth appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lands yet unknown and streams without a name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise into vision and demand their fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when a saint first gains his bright abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vaults o’er the spheres and views the works of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees earth, his kindred orb, beneath him roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here glow the centre, and there point the pole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er land and sea his eyes delighted rove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And human thoughts his heavenly joys improve;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With equal scope the raptured Hero’s sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranged the low vale, or climb’d the cloudy height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As, fixt in ardent look, his opening mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Explored the realms that here invite mankind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From sultry Mobile’s gulf-indented shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where Ontario hears his Lawrence roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretcht o’er the broadbackt hills in long array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tenfold Alleganies meet the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And show, far sloping from the plains and streams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forest azure streakt with orient beams.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High moved the scene, Columbus gazed sublime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus in prospect hail’d the happy clime:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blest be the race my guardian guide shall lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these wide vales with every bounty spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What treasured stores the hills must here combine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleep still ye diamonds, and ye ores refine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exalt your heads ye oaks, ye pines ascend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till future navies bid your branches bend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spread the canvass o’er the watery way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Explore new worlds and teach the old your sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said, and northward cast his curious eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On other cliffs of more exalted size.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Maine’s bleak breakers line the dangerous coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And isles and shoals their latent horrors boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High lantern’d in his heaven the cloudless White</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives the glad sailor an eternal light;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who far through troubled ocean greets the guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stems with steadier helm the stormful tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor could those heights unnoticed raise their head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That swell sublime o’er Hudson’s shadowy bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though fiction ne’er has hung them in the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though White and Andes far superior rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet hoary Kaatskill, where the storms divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would lift the heavens from Atlas’ laboring pride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Land after land his passing notice claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hills and mountains rise without a name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All yet unsung, their mystic powers untold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Celestials there no sacred senates hold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No chain’d Prometheus feasts the vulture there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No Cyclop forges through their summits glare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Phrygian Jove no victim smoke is curl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ark high landing quits a deluged world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But were these masses piled on Asia’s shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taurus would shrink, Hemodia boast no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indus and Ganges scorn their humble sires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rising suns salute superior fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose watchful priest would meet, with matin blaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His earlier god, and sooner chaunt his praise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here great nature with a bolder hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll’d the broad stream and heaved the lifted land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here, from finisht earth, triumphant trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last ascending steps of her creating God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He saw these mountains ope their watery stores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floods quit their caves and seek the distant shores;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild through disparting plains their waves expand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lave the banks where future towns must stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirl’d from the monstrous Andes’ bursting sides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maragnon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> leads his congregating tides;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand Alps for him dissolve their snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand Rhones obedient bend below;</span>

				<span>From different zones their ways converging wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweep beds of ore and leave their gold behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In headlong cataracts indignant rave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rush to his banks and swell the swallowing wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ucayla, first of all his mighty sons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Cusco’s walls a wearied journey runs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pastaza mines proud Pambamarca’s base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And holds through sundering hills his lawless race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aloft, where Cotopaxi flames on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The roaring Napo quits his misty sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the long steeps in whitening torrents driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like Nile descending from his fabled heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mound after mound impetuous Tigris rends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Curved Ista folds whole countries in his bends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vast Orinoco, summon’d forth to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His far fetcht honors to the sateless king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives on his own strong course to gain the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sends Catuba here with half his store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a broad Bosphorus here Negro guides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gather’d mass of fifty furious tides;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his waste world, by nameless fountains fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild Purus wears his long and lonely bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er twelve degrees of earth Madera flows,</span>

				<span>And robs the south of half its treasured snows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Zingus, of equal length and heavier force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolls on, for months, the same continuous course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reach his master’s bank, that here constrains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Topayo, charged with all Brazilla’s rains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While inland seas and lakes unknown to fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send their full tributes to the monarch stream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, swell’d with growing conquest, wheels abroad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drains every land, and gathers all his flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then far from clime to clime majestic goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enlarging, widening, deepening as he flows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like heaven’s broad milky way he shines alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spreads o’er the globe its equatorial zone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weighs the cleft continent and pushes wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its balanced mountains from each crumbling side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sire Ocean hears his proud Maragnon roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moves up his bed and seeks in vain the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then surging strong, with high and hoary tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whelms back the Stream and checks his rolling pride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Stream ungovernable foams with ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climbs, combs tempestuous, and attacks the Sire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth feels the conflict; onward still it spreads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her isles and uplands hide their woody heads;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>League after league from land to water change,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From realm to realm the seaborn monsters range;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vast midland heights but pierce the liquid plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old Andes tremble for their proud domain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the fresh Flood regains his forceful sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives back his father Ocean lasht with spray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose ebbing waters lead the downward sweep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waves and trees and banks roll whirling to the deep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where suns less ardent cast their golden beams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And minor Andes pour a waste of streams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marsh of Moxoe scoops the world, and fills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(From Bahia’s coast to Cochabamba’s hills)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand leagues of bog; he strives in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their floods to centre and their lakes retain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His gulfs o’ercharged their opening sides display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And southern vales prolong the seaward way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbus traced, with swift exploring eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The immense of waves that here exalted lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The realms that mound the unmeasured magazine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The far blue main, the climes that stretch between.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw Xaraya’s diamond banks unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Paraguay’s deep channel paved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> with gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw proud Potosi lift his glittering head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pour down Plata through his tinctured bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich with the spoils of many a distant mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his broad silver sea their floods combine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide over earth his annual freshet strays</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her long months of gradual waste repays;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her thirsty regions wait his glad return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drink their future harvest from his urn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where the cold circles gird the southern sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave Magellan’s wild channel caught his eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long cleft ridges wall’d the spreading way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gleams far westward to an unknown sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon as the distant swell was seen to roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His ancient wishes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> reabsorb’d his soul;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warm from his heaving heart a sudden sigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burst through his lips; he turn’d his moisten’d eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus besought his Angel: speak, my guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where leads the pass? and what yon purple tide?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the dim waves in blending ether stray!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No lands behind them rise, no pinions on them play.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There spreads, belike, that other unsail’d main</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I sought so long, and sought, alas, in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gird this watery globe, and bring to light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old India’s coast and regions wrapt in night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Restore, celestial friend, my youthful morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call back my years, and let my fame return;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me to trace, beyond that pathless sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some happier shore from lust of empire free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find in that far world a peaceful bower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From envy safe and curst Ovando’s power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth’s happiest realms let not their distance hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor seas forever roll their useless tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For nations yet unborn, that wait thy time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Demand their seats in that secluded clime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, grant me still, their passage to prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One venturous bark, and be my life thy care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So pray’d the Hero; Hesper mild replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divine compassion softening in his eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though still to virtuous deeds thy mind aspires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these glad visions kindle new desires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet hear with reverence what attends thy state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wish to pass the eternal bounds of fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led by this sacred light thou soon shalt see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That half mankind shall owe their home to thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom’s first empire claim its promised birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these rich rounds of sea-encircled earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let other years, by thine example prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call forth their heroes to explore the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through different seas a twofold passage lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where sweet India scents a waste of skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circling course, by Madagascar’s shores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round Afric’s cape, bold Gama now explores;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy well plann’d path these gleamy straits provide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor long shall rest the daring search untried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This idle frith must open soon to fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here a lost Lusitanian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> fix his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From that new main in furious waves be tost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fall neglected on the barbarous coast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But lo the chief! bright Albion bids him rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speed in his pinions, ardor in his eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither, O Drake, display thy hastening sails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Widen ye passes, and awake ye gales,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>March thou before him, courteous king of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wind his long course, illumine his pathless way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth’s distant shores, in circling bands unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lands, learn your fame, and oceans, roll in light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round all the watery globe his flag be hurl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A new Columbus to the astonisht world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke; and silent tow’rd the northern sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide o’er the hills the Hero cast his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the long floods through devious channels pour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wind their currents to the opening shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Interior seas and lonely lakes display</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their glittering glories to the beams of day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy capes, Virginia, towering from the tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raise their blue banks and slope thy barriers wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To future sails unfold an inland way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And guard secure thy multifluvian bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That drains uncounted realms and here unites</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The liquid mass from Alleganian heights.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>York leads his wave, imbankt in flowery pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nobler James falls winding by his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the hills, through many a silent vale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild Rappahanock seems to lure the sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Patapsco’s bosom courts the hand to toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dull Susquehanna laves a length of soil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mightier far, in sealike azure spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Potomac sweeps his earth disparting bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long dwelt his eye where these commingling pour’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their waves unkeel’d, their havens unexplored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where frowning forests stretch the dusky wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deadly damps forbid the flowers to spring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No seasons clothed the field with cultured grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No buoyant ship attempts the chartless main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, with impatient voice, My Seer, he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When shall my children cross the lonely tide?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, here my sons, the hand of culture bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here teach the lawn to smile, the grove to sing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye laboring floods, no longer vainly glide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye harvests load them, and ye forests ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear the deep burden from the joyous swain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell the world where peace and plenty reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hesper, to this returning no reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Presents new visions to his roving eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw broad Delaware the shores divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw majestic Hudson pour his tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy stream, my Hartford, through its misty robe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Play’d in the sunbeams, belting far the globe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No watery glades through richer valleys shine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor drinks the sea a lovelier wave than thine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mystic and Charles refresh their seaward isles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gay Piscateway pays his passing smiles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift Kenebec, high bursting from his lakes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoots down the hillsides through the clouds he makes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hoarse resounding, gulfing wide the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dread Lawrence labors with tremendous roar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lawrence, great son of Ocean! lorn he lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And braves the blasts of hyperborean skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where hoary winter holds his howling reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And April flings her timid showers in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Groans the choked Flood, in frozen fetters bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And isles of ice his angry front surround.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As old Enceladus, in durance vile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spreads his huge length beneath Sicilia’s isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her mass of mountains, on his body prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close not his veins nor still his laboring breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His limbs convulse, his heart rebellious rolls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth shakes responsive to her utmost poles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While rumbling, bursting boils his ceaseless ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flames to mid heaven, and sets the skies on fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the contristed Lawrence lays him low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hills of sleet and continents of snow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise on his crystal breast; his heaving sides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crash with the weight, and pour their gushing tides.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asouth, whence all his hundred branches bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Relenting airs with boreal blasts contend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in his vast extremes he swells and thaws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seas foam wide between his ice-bound jaws.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant Frost, to hold his captive, plies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hosted fiends that vex the polar skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unlocks his magazines of nitric stores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Azotic charms and muriatic powers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail, with its glassy globes, and brume congeal’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rime’s fleecy flakes, and storm that heaps the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike through the sullen Stream with numbing force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obstruct his sluices and impede his course.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vain he strives; his might interior fails;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor spring’s approach, nor earth’s whole heat avails;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He calls his hoary sire; old Ocean roars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Responsive echo through the Shetland shores.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He comes, the Father! from his bleak domains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break with liquid arms the sounding chains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in white majesty, he leads from far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His tides high foaming to the wintry war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Billows on billows lift the maddening brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seas and clouds in battling conflict join,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’erturn the vast gulf glade with rending sweep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crash the crust that bridged the boiling deep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till forced aloft, bright bounding through the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moves the blear ice and sheds a dazzling glare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The torn foundations on the surface ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrecks of winter load the downward tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The loosen’d ice isles o’er the main advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toss on the surge and through the concave dance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirl’d high, conjoin’d, in crystal mountains driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alp over Alp, they build a midway heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose million mirrors mock the solar ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And give condensed the tenfold glare of day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As tow’rd the south the mass enormous glides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brineless rivers furrow down its sides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thirsty sailor steals a glad supply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sultry trade winds quaff the boreal sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But oft insidious death, with mist o’erstrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rides the dark ocean on this icy throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When ships through vernal seas with light airs steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their midnight march and deem no danger near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The steerman gaily helms his course along</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laughs and listens to the watchman’s song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who walks the deck, enjoys the murky fog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure of his chart, his magnet and his log,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their shipmates dreaming, while their slumbers last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of joys to come, of toils and dangers past.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sudden a chilling blast comes roaring through</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trembling shrouds, and startles all the crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They spring to quarters, and perceive too late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mount of death, the giant strides of fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fullsail’d ship, with instantaneous shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dasht into fragments by the floating rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plunges beneath its basement through the wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crew and cargo glut the watery grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Say, Palfrey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> brave good man, was this thy doom?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwells here the secret of thy midsea tomb?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, Susan, why that tear? my lovely friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regret may last, but grief should have an end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An infant then, thy memory scarce can trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lines, though sacred, of thy father’s face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A generous spouse has well replaced the sire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New duties hence new sentiments require.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now where the lakes, those midland oceans, lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbus turn’d his heaven-illumined eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ontario’s banks, unable to retain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The five great Caspians from the distant main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burst with the ponderous mass, and forceful whirl’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His Lawrence forth, to balance thus the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above, bold Erie’s wave sublimely stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lookt o’er the cliff and heaved his headlong flood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where dread Niagara bluffs high his brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And frowns defiance to the world below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White clouds of mist expanding o’er him play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That tinge their skirts in all the beams of day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleased Iris wantons in perpetual pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bends her rainbows o’er the dashing tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far glimmering in the north, Black Huron runs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear Michigan reflects a thousand suns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bason’d high, on earth’s broad bosom gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bright Superior silvers down the day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Blue mounds beyond them far in ether fade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep groves between them cast a solemn shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slow moves their settling mist in lurid streams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dusky radiance streaks the solar beams.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt on the view the great discoverer stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus addrest the messenger of good:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But why these seats, that seem reserved to grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The social toils of some illustrious race?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why spread so wide and form’d so fair in vain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And why so distant rolls the bounteous main?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These happy regions must forever rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of man unseen, by native beasts possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the best heritage my sons could boast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elude their search in far dim deserts lost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For see, no ship can point her pendants here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No stream conducts nor ocean wanders near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frost, crags and cataracts their north invest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the tired sun scarce finds their bounds awest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the Seraph: Here indeed retires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The happiest land that feels my fostering fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here too shall numerous nations found their seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peace and freedom bless the kind retreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led by this arm thy sons shall hither come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And streams obedient yield the heroes room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread a broad passage to their well known main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor sluice their lakes nor form their soils in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here my bold Mississippi bends his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorns the dim bounds of yon bleak boreal day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And calls from western heavens, to feed his stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rains and floods that Asian seas might claim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong in his march and charged with all the fates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of regions pregnant with a hundred states,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He holds in balance, ranged on either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two distant oceans and their sundering land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commands and drains the interior tracts that lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outmeasuring Europe’s total breadth of sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High in the north his parent fountains wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oozing urns adorn his infant head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vain proud Frost his nursing lakes would close</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And choke his channel with perennial snows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all their slopes he curves his countless rills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweeps their long marshes, saps their settling hills;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then stretching, straightening south, he gaily gleams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swells through the climes and swallows all their streams;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From zone to zone, o’er earth’s broad surface curl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cleaves his course, he furrows half the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now roaring wild through bursting mountains driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now calm reflecting all the host of heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Cynthia pausing, her own face admires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And suns and stars repeat their dancing fires.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide o’er his meadowy lawns he spreads and feeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His realms of canes, his waving world of reeds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where mammoths grazed the renovating groves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaked their huge thirst and chill’d their fruitless loves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where elks, rejoicing o’er the extinguished race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By myriads rise to fill the vacant space.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth’s widest gulf expands to meet his wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vast isles of ocean in his current lave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glad Thetis greets him from his finisht course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bathes her Nereids in his freshening source.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To his broad bed their tributary stores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisconsin here, there lonely Peter pours;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Croix, from the northeast wilds, his channel fills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ohio, gather’d from his myriad hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yazoo and Black, surcharged by Georgian springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich Illinois his copious treasure brings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arkansas, measuring back the sun’s long course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moine, Francis, Rouge augment the father’s force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But chief of all his family of floods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Missouri marches through his world of woods;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He scorns to mingle with the filial train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes every course to reach alone the main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Orient awhile his bending sweep he tries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now drains the southern, now the northern skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searches and sunders far the globe’s vast frame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reluctant joins the sire, and takes at last his name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There lies the path thy future sons shall trace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plant here their arts, and rear their vigorous race:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A race predestined, in these choice abodes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To teach mankind to tame their fluvial floods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Retain from ocean, as their work requires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These great auxiliars, raised by solar fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Force them to form ten thousand roads, and girth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With liquid belts each verdant mound of earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid the colon’s as the carrier’s toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drive the coulter and to fat the soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learn all mechanic arts and oft regain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their native hills in vapor and in rain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So taught the Saint. The regions nearer drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And raised resplendent to their Hero’s view</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich nature’s triple reign; for here elate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She stored the noblest treasures of her state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adorn’d exuberant this her last domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As yet unalter’d by her mimic man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sow’d liveliest gems and plants of proudest grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strung with strongest nerves her animated race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Retiring far round Hudson’s frozen bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth’s lessening circles shrink beyond the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snows ever rising with the toils of time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Choke the chill shrubs that brave the dismal clime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beasts all whitening<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> roam the lifeless plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And caves unfrequent scoop the couch for man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where spring’s coy steps in cold Canadia stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And joyless seasons hold unequal sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw the pine its daring mantle rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break the rude blast, and mock the brumal year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shag the green zone that bounds the boreal skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid all southern vegetation rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild o’er the vast impenetrable round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The untrod bowers of shadowy nature frown’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Millennial cedars wave their honors wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fir’s tall boughs, the oak’s umbrageous pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The branching beech, the aspen’s trembling shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veil the dim heaven and brown the dusky glade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in dense crowds these sturdy sons of earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In frosty regions claim a stronger birth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where heavy beams the sheltering dome requires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And copious trunks to feed its wintry fires.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But warmer suns, that southern zones emblaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cool thin umbrage o’er their woodland raise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floridia’s shores their blooms around him spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Georgian hills erect their shady head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose flowery shrubs regale the passing air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the untasted fragrance of the year.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath tall trees, dispersed in loose array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rice-grown lawns their humble garb display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The infant maize, unconscious of its worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Points the green spire and bends the foliage forth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In various forms unbidden harvests rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blooming life repays the genial skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where Mexic hills the breezy gulf defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spontaneous groves with richer burdens bend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anana’s stalk its shaggy honors yields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Acacia’s flowers perfume a thousand fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their cluster’d dates the mast-like palms unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spreading orange waves a load of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Connubial vines o’ertop the larch they climb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long-lived olive mocks the moth of time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pomona’s pride, that old Grenada claims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here smiles and reddens in diviner flames;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pimento, citron scent the sky serene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White woolly clusters fringe the cotton’s green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sturdy fig, the frail deciduous cane</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And foodful cocoa fan the sultry plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, in one view, the same glad branches bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fruits of autumn and the flowers of spring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No wintry blasts the unchanging year deform,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor beasts unshelter’d fear the pinching storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But vernal breezes o’er the blossoms rove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breathe the ripen’d juices through the grove.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beneath the crystal wave’s inconstant light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pearls burst their shells to greet the Hero’s sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From opening earth in living lustre shine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The various treasures of the blazing mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hills, cleft before him, all their stores unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pale platina and the burning gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver whole mounds, and gems of dazzling ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Illume the rocks and shed the beams of day.</span>
