				<span>In one dark age beneath a single hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus rose an empire in the savage land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its wealth and power with following years increase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its growing nations spread the walks of peace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Religion here, that universal name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man’s proudest passion, most ungovern’d flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Erects her altars on the same bright base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That dazzled erst, and still deludes the race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sun, moon, all powers that forceful strike his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth-shaking storms and constellated skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet all the pomp his labors here unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vales of verdure and the towers of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those infant arts and sovereign seats of state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In short-lived glory hasten to their fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy followers, rushing like an angry flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too soon shall drench them in the nation’s blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor thou, Las Casas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a> best of men, shalt stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ravening legions from their guardless prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O hapless prelate! hero, saint and sage!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foredoom’d with crimes a fruitless war to wage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see at last, thy life of virtue run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A realm unpeopled and a world undone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While impious Valverde, mock of priesthood stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guilt in his heart, the gospel in his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bids in one field their unarm’d thousands bleed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiles o’er the scene and sanctifies the deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, brave Gasca, with persuasive strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shalt lift thy voice and urge thy power in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vain are thy hopes the sinking land to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or call her slaughter’d millions from the grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here Hesper paused. Columbus with a sigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast o’er the continent his moisten’d eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus replied: Ah, hide me in the tomb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why should I live to see the impending doom?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If such foul deeds the scheme of heaven compose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And virtue’s toils induce redoubled woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfold no more; but grant a kind release;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me, ’tis all I ask, to rest in peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thou shalt rest in peace, the Saint rejoin’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere these conflicting shades involve mankind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But broader views shall first thy mind engage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Years far advanced beyond this darksome age</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall feast thee here; the fruits of thy long care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A grateful world beneath thy ken shall share.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Europe’s contending kings shall soon behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These fertile plains and hills of treasured gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the path of thy adventurous sail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their countless navies float on every gale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For wealth and commerce search the western shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And load each ocean with the shining ore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As up the orient heaven the dawning ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiles o’er the hills and gives the promised day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives fraud and rapine from their nightly spoil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And social nature wakes to various toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So from the blazing mine the golden store</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid rival states shall spread from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unite their force, its opulence to share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Extend the pomp but sooth the rage of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide through the world while genius unconfined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tempts loftier flights and opens all the mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dissolves the slavish bands of monkish lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wakes the bold arts and bids the Muses soar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then shall thy northern climes their seats display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>United nations there commence their sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er earth and ocean spread their peerless fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And send through time thy patriarchal name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now turn thy view to Europe; see the rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of feudal faction every court engage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All honest labor, all commercial ties</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their kings discountenance, their lords despise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The naked harbors looking to the main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rear their kind cliffs and break the storms in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The willing wave no foreign treasures lade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor sails nor cities cast a watery shade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save, where yon opening gulf the strand divides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proud Venice bathes her in the broken tides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weds her tamed sea, shakes every distant throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deems by right the naval world her own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet must we mark, the bondage of the mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spreads deeper glooms and subjugates mankind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The zealots fierce, whom local creeds enrage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In holy feuds perpetual combat wage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Support all crimes by full indulgence given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Usurp the power and wield the sword of heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But lo, where future years their scenes unroll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rising arts inspire the venturous soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all the ports that cleave the coast of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New fleets ascending streak the western main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Tago’s bank, from Albion’s rocky round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commercing squadrons o’er the billows bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Afric’s isles observe the sweeping sails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full pinions tossing in Arabian gales,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indus and Ganges deep in canvass lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And navies crowding round Cambodia’s coast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New nations rise, all climes and oceans brave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shade with sheets the immeasurable wave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See lofty Ximenes with solemn gait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move from the cloister to the walks of state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through the factious monarchies of Spain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Curb the fierce lords and fix one royal reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold dread Charles the imperial seat ascends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Europe’s thrones his conquering arm extends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While wealthier shores beneath the western day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfold their treasures to confirm his sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roused at false glory’s fascinating call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See Francis train the gallant youths of Gaul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’erstrain the strength of her extended states,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scale the proud Alps or burst their granite gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Pavia’s plain for Caesar’s crown contend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of arms the votary but of arts the friend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And see proud Wolsey rise, securely great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kings at his call and mitres round him wait;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From monkish walls the hoarded wealth he draws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid the tyrant and restrain the laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wakes Albion’s genius, neighboring princes braves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shares with them the commonwealth of waves,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold dark Solyman from eastern skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his grim host magnificently rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wave his broad crescent o’er the midland sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through vast Hungaria drive his conquering way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowd close the christian powers and carry far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rules of homicide, the lore of war.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Tuscan dukes excite a nobler strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lorenzo calls the Fine Arts forth to life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair nature’s mimic maids; whose powers divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her charms develop and her laws define;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From sire to son the splendid labors spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Leo follows where good Cosmo led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waked from the ground that Gothic rovers trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts the bronze hero and the marble god;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Monks, prelates, pontiffs pay the reverence due</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To that bold taste their Grecian masters knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resurgent temples throng the Latian shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pencil triumphs and the Muses soar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O’er the dark world Erasmus rears his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In schoolman lore sees kings and nations lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With strength of judgment and with fancy warm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Derides their follies and dissolves the charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears the deep veil that bigot zeal has thrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On pagan books and science long unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From faith in senseless rites relieves mankind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seats bold virtue in the conscious mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But still the frightful task, to face alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The jealous vengeance of the papal throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Restrains his hand; he gives the contest o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leaves his hardier sons to curb that power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Luther walks forth in yon majestic frame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright beam of heaven, and heir of endless fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born like thyself through toils and griefs to wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From slavery’s chains to free the captive mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave adverse crowns, control the pontiff sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring benighted nations into day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Remark what crowds his name around him brings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Schools, synods, prelates, potentates and kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All gaining knowledge from his boundless store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And join’d to shield him from the papal power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First of his friends<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a> see Frederic’s princely form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ward from the sage divine the gathering storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In learned Wittenberg secure his seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High throne of thought, religion’s safe retreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There sits Melancthon, mild as morning light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feuds, though sacred, soften in his sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In terms so gentle flows his tuneful tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even cloister’d bigots join the pupil throng;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By all sectarian chiefs he lives approved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By monarchs courted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and by men beloved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And lo, where Europe’s utmost limits bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From this new source what various lights ascend!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See haughty Henry, from the papal tie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His realms dissever, and the priest defy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Albion’s sons disdain a foreign throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learn to bound the oppressions of their own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rises Loyola, a strange new name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By paths unseen to reach the goal of fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through courts and camps he teaches how to wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mine whole states and overreach mankind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Train’d in his school, a bold and artful race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Range o’er the world and every sect embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All creeds and powers and policies explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New seats of science raise on every shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till their wide empire gains a wondrous birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built in all empires o’er this ancient earth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our wildmen too, the tribes of Paraguay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Receive their rites and bow beneath their sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The world of men thus moving in thy view</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Improve their state, more useful works pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwonted deeds in rival greatness shine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call’d into life, and first inspired by thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So while imperial Homer tunes the lyre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His living lays unnumber’d bards inspire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From age to age the kindling spirit flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sounds through the earth and echoes to the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now roll the years, when Europe’s ample space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By peace and culture rears a wiser race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men bred to labor, school’d in freedom’s lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And formed to colonize our favorite shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speed their course, the sons of bigot rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In persecution whelm the inquiring age;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myriads of martyr’d heroes mount the pyre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blind devotion lights the sacred fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Led by the dark Dominicans of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A newborn Fury walks the wide domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaunt <strong>Inquisition</strong>; mark her giant stride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her blood-nursed vulture screaming at her side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her priestly train the tools of torment brings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Racks, wheels and crosses, faggots, stakes and strings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scaffolds and cages round her altar stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, tipt with sulphur, waves her flaming brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her imps of inquest round the fiend advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suspectors grave and spies with eye askance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pretended heretics who worm the soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sly confessors with their secret scroll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accusers hired, for each conviction paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Judges retain’d and witnesses by trade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dragged from a thousand jails her victim trains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jews, Moors and Christians clank alike their chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Read their known sentence in her fiery eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breathe to heaven their unavailing cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lasht on the pile their writhing bodies turn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And veil’d in doubling smoke begin to burn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the flames open, lo their limbs in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reach out for help, distorted by the pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till folded in the fires they disappear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not a sound invades the startled ear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See Philip throned in insolence and pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enjoy their wailings and their pangs deride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While o’er the same dread scenes on Albion’s isles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His well-taught spouse, the cruel Mary smiles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What clouds of smoke hang heavy round the shore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What altars hecatomb’d with christian gore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her sire’s best friends, the wise, the brave, the good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll in the flames or fly the land of blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Gallia’s plains the maddening frenzy turns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Religion raves and civil discord burns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaguers and Huguenots their vengeance pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They swell Bartholemy’s wide feast of gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alternate victors bid their gibbets rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the foul stench of victims chokes the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now cease the factions with the Valois line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Bourbon’s virtues every voice combine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quell’d by his fame, the furious sects accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Europe respires beneath his guardian sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Batavia’s states to independence soar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And curb the cohorts of Iberian power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Albion’s ports her infant navies heave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretch forth and thunder on the Flandrian wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her Howard there first foils the force of Spain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there begins her mastery of the main.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Seraph spoke; when full beneath their eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A new-form’d squadron rose along the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on the tallest deck majestic shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sage Raleigh, pointing to the western sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eye, bent forward, ardent and sublime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seem’d piercing nature and evolving time;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside him stood a globe, whose figures traced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A future empire in each present waste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All former works of men behind him shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graved by his hand in ever during stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his calm brow a various crown displays</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero’s laurel and the scholar’s bays;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His graceful limbs in steely mail were drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bright star burning on his lofty breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sword high waving flash’d the solar ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Illumed the shrouds and rainbow’d far the spray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The smiling crew rose resolute and brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the glad sails hung bounding o’er the wave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Storms of wild Hatteras, suspend your roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye tumbling billows, cease to shake the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look through the doubling clouds, thou lamp of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teach the bold Argonauts their chartless way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your viewless capes, broad Chesapeake, unfold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And show your promised Colchis fleeced with gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No plundering squadron your new Jason brings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No pirate demigods nor hordes of kings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From shore to shore a faithless miscreant steers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To steal a maid and leave a sire in tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But yon wise chief conducts with careful ken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The queen of colonies, the best of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wake to fruitful life your slumbering soil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rear an empire with the hand of toil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your fond Medea too, whose dauntless breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All danger braves to screen her hunted guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall quit her native tribe, but never share</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crimes and sufferings of the Colchian fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blest Pocahontas, fear no lurking guile;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy hero’s love shall well reward thy smile.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, sooth the wanderer in his desperate plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide him by day and calm his cares by night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though savage nations with thy vengeful sire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pursue their victim with unceasing ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though their threats thy startled ear assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let virtue’s voice o’er filial fears prevail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly with the faithful youth, his steps to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierce the known thicket, breast the fordless tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elude the scout, avoid the ambusht line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lead him safely to his friends and thine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thine shall be his friends, his heart, his name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His camp shall shout, his nation boast thy fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now the bay unfolds a passage wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leads the squadron up the freshening tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Pohatan spreads deep her sylvan soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grassy lawns allure the steps of toil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, lodged in peace, they tread the welcome land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An instant harvest waves beneath their hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spontaneous fruits their easy cares beguile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And opening fields in living culture smile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With joy Columbus view’d; when thus his voice:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye grove-clad shores, ye generous hosts rejoice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exchange your benefits, your gifts combine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What nature fashions, let her sons refine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be thou, my seer, the people’s guardian friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Protect their virtues and their lives defend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May wealth and wisdom with their arts unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet save, oh save them from the thirst of gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the poor guardless natives never feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flamen’s fraud, the soldier’s fateful steel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But learn the blessings that alone attend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On civil rights where social virtues blend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these brave leaders find a welcome guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rear their fanes and empires by their side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smile, great Hesperia, smile; the star of morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Illumes thy heavens and bids thy day be born;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy opening forests show the work begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy plains unshaded drink a purer sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yield now thy bounties, load the laboring main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give birth to nations, and begin thy reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Hero spoke; when thus the Saint rejoin’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approved his joy and feasted still his mind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well may thy voice, with patriarch pride elate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burst forth triumphant at a scene so great.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here springs indeed the day, since time began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brightest, broadest, happiest morn of man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these prime settlements thy raptures trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The germ, the genius of a sapient race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Predestined here to methodize and mold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New codes of empire to reform the old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A work so vast a second world required,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By oceans bourn’d, from elder states retired;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, uncontaminated, unconfined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free contemplation might expand the mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To form, fix, prove the well-adjusted plan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And base and build the commonwealth of man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This arm, that leads the stellar host of even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stretcht o’er yon rude ridge the western heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That heal’d the wounded earth when from her side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moon burst forth and left the South Sea tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That calm’d these elements and taught them where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mold their mass and rib the crusted sphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Line the closed continent with wrecks of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And recommence their generating strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rear’d the mountain, spread the subject plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led the long stream and roll’d the billowy main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stole from retiring tides the growing strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaved the green banks, the shadowy inlets plann’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strow’d the wild fruitage, gave the beast his place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And form’d the region for thy filial race⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This arm prepared their future seats of state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Design’d their limits and prescribed their date.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When first the staggering globe its breach repair’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this bold hemisphere its shoulders rear’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to those heights, whose hovering vapor shrouds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My rock-raised world in Alleganian clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Atlantic waste its coral kingdom spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scaly nations here their gambols led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till by degrees, through following tracts of time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From laboring ocean rose the sedgy clime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As from unloaded waves, the rising sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swell’d into light and gently drew to land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, moved by trade winds o’er the flaming zone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves roll westward with the constant sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meet my firm isthmus, scoop that gulfy bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheel to the north and here their current spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those ravaged banks, that move beneath their force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne on the tide and lost along their course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Create the shore, consolidate the soil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hither lead the enlighten’d steps of toil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Think not the lust of gold shall here annoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enslave the nation and its nerve destroy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No useles mine these northern hills enclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No ruby ripens and no diamond glows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But richer stores and rocks of useful mold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repay in wealth the penury of gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom’s unconquer’d race with healthy toil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall lop the grove and warm the furrow’d soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From iron ridges break the rugged ore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And plant with men the man-ennobling shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sails, villas, towers and temples round them heave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine o’er the realms and light the distant wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor think the native tribes shall rue the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That leads our heroes o’er the watery way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cause like theirs no mean device can mar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor bigot rage nor sacerdotal war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From eastern tyrants driven, resolved and brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To build new states or seek a distant grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our sons shall try a new colonial plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tame the soil, but spare their kindred man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through Europe’s wilds when feudal nations spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pride of conquest every legion led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each fur-clad chief, by servile crowds adored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er conquer’d realms assumed the name of lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built the proud castle, ranged the savage wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fired his grim host to frequent fields of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With new made honors lured his subject bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Price of their lives, and purchase of their lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For names and titles bade the world resign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their faith, their freedom and their rights divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Contending baronies their terrors spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slavery follow’d where the standard led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, little tyrants by the great o’erthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spoils of nobles build the regal crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wealth, wisdom, virtue, every claim of man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unguarded fall to consummate the plan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambitious cares, that nature never gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Torment alike the monarch and the slave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all degrees in gradual pomp ascend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honor the name, but tyranny the end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far different honors here the heart shall claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sublimer objects, deeds of happier fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A new creation waits the western shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moral triumphs o’er monarchic power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy freeborn sons, with genius unconfined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor sloth can slacken nor a tyrant bind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With self-wrought fame and worth internal blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No venal star shall brighten on their breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor king-created name nor courtly art</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damp the bold thought or desiccate the heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above all fraud, beyond all titles great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth in their voice and sceptres at their feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sires of unborn states they move sublime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look empires through and span the breadth of time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold o’er the world, that men may choose from far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palm of peace, or scourge of barbarous war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till their example every nation charms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commands its friendship and its rage disarms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here social man a second birth shall find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a new range of reason lift his mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed his strong intellect with purer light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A nobler sense of duty and of right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sense of liberty; whose holy fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His life shall temper and his laws inspire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Purge from all shades the world-embracing scope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That prompts his genius and expands his hope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When first his form arose erect on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parturient nature hail’d the wondrous birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With fairest limbs and finest fibres wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And framed for vast and various toils of thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid his promised powers with loftier flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stretch his views beyond corporeal sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prometheus came and from the floods of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sunn’d his clear soul with heaven’s internal ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The expanding spark divine, that round him springs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leads and lights him through the immense of things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Probes the dense earth, explores the soundless main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remolds their mass through all its threefold reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er great, o’er small extends his physic laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impalms the empyrean or dissects a gaz,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weighs the vast orbs of heaven, bestrides the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks on the windows of an insect’s eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns then to self, more curious still to trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whirls of passion that involve the race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cloud with mist the visual lamp of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And plunge the poniard in fraternal blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here fails his light. The proud Titanian ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er physic nature sheds indeed its day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet leaves the moral in chaotic jars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spoil of violence, the sport of wars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Presents contrasted parts of one great plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth, heaven subdued, but man at swords with man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wars, his errors into science grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the great cause of all his ills unknown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when he steps on these regenerate shores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mind unfolding for superior powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><strong>Freedom</strong>, his new Prometheus, here shall rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Light her new torch in my refulgent skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch with a stronger life his opening soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of moral systems fix the central goal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own resplendent essence. Thence expand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rays of reason that illume the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence equal rights proceed and equal laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence holy Justice all her reverence draws;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth with untarnish’d beam descending thence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes every eye, and quickens every sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bids bright Instruction spread her ample page</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drive dark dogmas from the inquiring age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ope the true treasures of the earth and skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And teach the student where his object lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sun of the moral world! effulgent source</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of man’s best wisdom and his steadiest force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soul-searching Freedom! here assume thy stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And radiate hence to every distant land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point out and prove how all the scenes of strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shock of states, the impassion’d broils of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spring from unequal sway; and how they fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the splendor of thy peaceful eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfold at last the genuine social plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mind’s full scope, the dignity of man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bold nature bursting through her long disguise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nations daring to be just and wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes! righteous Freedom, heaven and earth and sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yield or withold their various gifts for thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Protected Industry beneath thy reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leads all the virtues in her filial train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courageous Probity with brow serene</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Temperance calm presents her placid mien;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contentment, Moderation, Labor, Art</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mold the new man and humanize his heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To public plenty private ease dilates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Domestic peace to harmony of states.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Protected Industry, careering far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Detects the cause and cures the rage of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweeps with forceful arm to their last graves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kings from the earth and pirates from the waves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But slow proceeds the work. Long toils, my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must base the fabric of so vast a throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Freedom founds her everlasting reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And earth’s whole empires form the fair domain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That great coloniarch, whose exalted soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pervades all scenes that future years unroll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must yield the palm and at a courtier’s shrine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His plans relinquish and his life resign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His life that brightens, as his death shall stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair, foul annals of his master’s reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That feeble band, the lonely wilds who tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sire, their genius in their Raleigh dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall pine and perish in the savage gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or mount the wave and seek their ancient home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others in vain the generous task pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dangers tempt and all the strife renew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While kings and ministers obstruct<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a> the plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfaithful guardians of the weal of man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last brave Delaware with his blithe host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sails in full triumph to the well known coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aids with a liberal hand the patriot cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reforms their policy, designs their laws;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till o’er Virginia’s plains they spread their sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And push their hamlets tow’rd the setting day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He comes, my Delaware! how mild and bland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My zephyrs greet him from the long-sought land!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From fluvial glades that through my cantons run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From those rich mounds that mask the falling sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Borne up my Chesapeake, as first he hails</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flowery banks that scent his slackening sails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descending twilight mellows down the gleam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That spreads far forward on the broad blue stream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moonbeam dancing, as the pendants glide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silvers with trembling tints the ripply tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sand-sown beach, the rocky bluff repays</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faint effulgence with their amber’d rays;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er greenwood glens a browner lustre flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bright-hair’d hills walk shadowy round the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Profound solicitude and strong delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Absorb the chief as through the waste of night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He walks the lonely deck and skirts the lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wait their nations from his guiding hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tall through the tide the river gods by turns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise round the bark and blend their social urns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Majestic brotherhood! each feels the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feed an empire from his future store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They stand stupendous, flooding full the bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pointing each through different climes the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Resplendent o’er the rest, the regent god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Potomac towers and sways the swelling flood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vines clothe his arms, wild fruits o’erfill his horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wreaths of green maize his reverend brows adorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His silver beard reflects the lunar day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And round his loins the scaly nations play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The breeze falls calm, the sails in silence rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While thus his greetings cheer the stranger guest:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Blest be the bark that seized the promised hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To waft thee welcome to this friendly shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long have we learnt the fame that here awaits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The future sires of our unplanted states;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We all salute thee with our mingling tides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our high-fenced havens and our fruitful sides.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hundred realms our myriad fountains drain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall lose their limits in the vast domain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my bold banks with proud impatience wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palm of glory in a work so great;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On me thy sons their central seat shall raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crown my labors with distinguisht praise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this, from rock-ribb’d lakes I forced my birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And climb’d and sunder’d many a mound of earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rent the huge hills that yonder heave on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with their tenfold ridges rake the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Removed whole mountains in my headlong way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strow’d a strong soil around this branching bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scoop’d wide his basins to the distant main</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hung with headlands every marsh they drain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Haste then, my heroes, tempt the fearless toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enrich your nations with the nurturing spoil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er my vast vales let yellow harvests wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quay the calm ports and dike the lawns I lave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Win from the waters every stagnant fen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where truant rills escape my conscious ken;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And break those remnant rocks that still impede</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My current crowding through the gaps I made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So shall your barks pursue my branching bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slope after slope, to every fountain’s head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seat your contiguous towns on all my shores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And charge my channel with their seaward stores.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom and peace shall well reward your care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My guardian mounds protect the friendly pair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if delirious war shall dare draw nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eastern storms o’ercast the western sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soil shall rear the chief to guide your host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drive the demon cringing from the coast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon verdant hill his sylvan seat shall claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grow immortal from his deathless fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then shall your federal towers my bank adorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hail with me the great millennial morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gilds your capitol. Thence earth shall draw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her first clear codes of liberty and law;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There public right a settled form shall find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth trim her lamp to lighten humankind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old Afric’s sons their shameful fetters cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our wild Hesperians humanize at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All men participate, all time expand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The source of good my liberal sages plann’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, he plunges in the sacred flood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That closes calm and lulls the cradled god.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exulting at his words, the gallant crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brace the broad canvas and their course pursue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the breathing airs, from ocean born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breeze up the bay, and lead the lively morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lights them to their port. ’Tis here they join</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bold precursors in the work divine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here their followers, yet a numerous train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wind o’er the wave and swell the new domain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For impious Laud, on England’s wasted shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Renews the flames that Mary fed before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contristed sects his sullen fury fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek new seats beneath a safer sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where faith and freedom yield a forceful charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toils and dangers every bosom warm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid the tried unconquerable train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom tyrants press and seas oppose in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See Plymouth colons stretch their standards o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Face the dark wildmen and the wintry shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See virtuous Baltimore ascend the wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See peaceful Penn its unknown terrors brave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swedes, Belgians, Gauls their various flags display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full pinions crowding on the watery way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All from their different ports, their sails unfurl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point their glad streamers to the western world.</span>
