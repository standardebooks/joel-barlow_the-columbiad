				<span>But of all tales that war’s black annals hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The darkest, foulest still remains untold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New modes of torture wait the shameful strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Britain wantons in the waste of life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cold-blooded Cruelty, first fiend of hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah think no more with savage hordes to dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit the Caribbean tribes who eat their slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly that grim gang, the Inquisitors of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boast not thy deeds in Moloch’s shrines of old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave Barbary’s pirates to their blood-bought gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let Holland steal her victims, force them o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To toils and death on Java’s morbid shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some cloak, some color all these crimes may plead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis avarice, passion, blind religion’s deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Britons here, in this fraternal broil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grave, cool, deliberate in thy service toil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far from the nation’s eye, whose nobler soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wars would humanize, their pride control,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They lose the lessons that her laws impart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And change the British for the brutal heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fired by no passion, madden’d by no zeal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No priest, no Plutus bids them not to feel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unpaid, gratuitous, on torture bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sport is death, their pastime to torment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All other gods they scorn, but bow the knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And curb, well pleased, O Cruelty, to thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Come then, curst goddess, where thy votaries reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inhale their incense from the land and main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to New York, their conquering arms to greet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brood o’er their camp and breathe along their fleet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brother chiefs of Howe’s illustrious name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Demand thy labors to complete their fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What shrieks of agony thy praises sound!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What grateless dungeons groan beneath the ground!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See the black<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> Prison Ship’s expanding womb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impested thousands, quick and dead, entomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Barks after barks the captured seamen bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transboard and crowd thy silent victims there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred scows, from all the neighboring shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread the dull sail and ply the constant oar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waft wrecks of armies from the well fought field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And famisht garrisons who bravely yield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They mount the hulk, and, cramm’d within the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail their last house, their living, floating grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She comes, the fiend! her grinning jaws expand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her brazen eyes cast lightning o’er the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her wings like thunder-clouds the welkin sweep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brush the tall spires and shade the shuddering deep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gains the deck, displays her wonted store</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her cords and scourges wet with prisoners’ gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gripes, pincers, thumb-screws spread beneath her feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slow poisonous drugs and loads of putrid meat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disease hangs drizzling from her slimy locks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hot contagion issues from her box.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O’er the closed hatches ere she takes her place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She moves the massy planks a little space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opes a small passage to the cries below</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That feast her soul on messages of woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There sits with gaping ear and changeless eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drinks every groan and treasures every sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sustains the faint, their miseries to prolong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Revives the dying and unnerves the strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But as the infected mass resign their breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She keeps with joy the register of death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As tost through portholes from the encumber’d cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corpse after corpse fall dashing in the wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corpse after corpse, for days and months and years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tide bears off, and still its current clears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last, o’erloaded with the putrid gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slime-clad waters thicken round the shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green Ocean’s self, that oft his wave renews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That drinks whole fleets with all their slaughter’d crews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That laves, that purifies the earth and sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet ne’er before resign’d his natural dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here purples, blushes for the race he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rob and ravage this unconquer’d shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scaly nations, as they travel by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch the contagion, sicken, gasp and die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Hesper turns the Hero’s tearful eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To other fields where other standards fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here constrain’d new warfare to disclose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And show the feats of more than mortal foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where interposing with celestial might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own dread labors must decide the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bids the scene with pomp unusual rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To teach Columbus how to read the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He marks the trace of Howe’s triumphant course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wheels o’er Jersey plains his gathering force;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where dauntless Washington begirt with foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still greater rises as the danger grows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wearied troops, o’er kindred warriors slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Attend his march through many a sanguine plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From Hudson’s bank to Trenton’s wintry strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He guards in firm retreat his feeble band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Britons by thousands on his flanks advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bend o’er his rear and point the lifted lance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past Delaware’s frozen stream, with scanty force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He checks retreat; then turning back his course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remounts the wave and through the mingled roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ice and storm reseeks the hostile shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapt in the gloom of night. The offended Flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts from his cave, assumes the indignant god,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rears through the parting tide his foamy form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with his fiery eyeballs lights the storm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He stares around him on the host he heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clears his choked urn and smooths his icy beard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus: Audacious chief, this troubled wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tempt not; or tempting, here shall gape thy grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is nothing sacred to thy venturous might?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The howling storm, the holy truce of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High tossing ice-isles crashing round thy side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Insidious rocks that pierce the tumbling tide?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear then this forceful arm, and hear once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death stands between thee and that shelvy shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The chief beholds the god and notes his cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But onward drives, nor pauses to reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls to each bark and spirits every host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To toil, gain, tempt the interdicted coast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crews, regardless of the doubling roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breast the strong helm and wrestle with the oar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stem with resurgent prow the struggling spray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with phosphoric lanterns shape their way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The god perceived his warning words were vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rose more furious to assert his reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lasht up a loftier surge and heaved on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ridge of billows that obstruct the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as the accumulated mass he rolls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bares the sharp rocks and lifts the gaping shoals.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forward the fearless barges plunge and bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Top the curl’d wave, or grind the flinty ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Careen, whirl, right, and sidelong dasht and tost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now seem to reach and now to lose the coast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still unsubdued the sea-drench’d army toils,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each buoyant skiff the flouncing godhead foils;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He raves and roars, and in delirious woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls to his aid his ancient hoary foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almighty Frost; when thus the vanquisht Flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bespeaks in haste the great earth-rending god:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Father of storms! behold this mortal race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confound my force and brave me to my face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all my waves by all my tempests driven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor black night brooding o’er the starless heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can check their course; they toss and plunge amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lo my guardian rocks project their points in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Come to my help, and with thy stiffening breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clog their strain’d helms, distend their limbs in death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though ancient enmity our realms divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft thy chains arrest my laboring tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let strong necessity our cause combine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy own disgrace anticipate in mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even now their oars thy sleet in vain congeals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy crumbling ice-cakes crash beneath their keels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their impious arms already cope with ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mortal man defies immortal Powers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roused at the call, the monarch mounts the storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In muriat flakes he robes his nitrous form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glares through the compound, all its blast inhales,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seas turn crystal where he breathes his gales.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He comes careering o’er his bleak domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But comes untended by his usual train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail, sleet and snow-rack far behind him fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too weak to wade through this petrific sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose air consolidates and cuts and stings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shakes hoar tinsel from its flickering wings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth heaves and cracks beneath the alighting god;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gains the pass, bestrides the roaring flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoots from his nostrils one wide withering sheet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of treasured meteors on the struggling fleet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves conglaciate instant, fix in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand like a ridge of rocks, and shiver there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The barks confounded in their headlong surge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or wedged in crystal cease their oars to urge;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some with prone prow, as plunging down the deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some remounting o’er the slippery steep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seem laboring still, but moveless, lifeless all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the chill’d army here awaits its fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Hesper, guardian of Hesperia’s right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his far heaven looks through the rayless night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stung to vengeance at the unequal strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save her host, in jeopardy of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts from his throne, ascends his flamy car</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turns tremendous to the field of war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wheels, resurging from the depth of even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll back the night, streak wide the startled heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regain their easting with reverted gyres</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stud their path with scintillating fires.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cleaves the clouds; and, swift as beams of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er California sweeps his splendid way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Missouri’s mountains at his passage nod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now sad Delaware feels the present god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trembles at his tread. For here to fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rush two dread Powers of such unmeasured might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As threats to annihilate his doubtful reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Convulse the heaven and mingle earth and main.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Frost views his brilliant foe with scornful eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whirls a tenfold tempest through the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where each fine atom of the immense of air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steel’d, pointed, barb’d for unexampled war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings o’er the shuddering ground; when thus he broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contemptuous silence, and to Hesper spoke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou comest in time to share their last disgrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To change to crystal with thy rebel race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretch thy huge corse o’er Delaware’s bank afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learn the force of elemental war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if undying life thy lamp inspire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take that one blast and to thy sky retire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There, roll’d eternal round the heavens, proclaim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy own disaster and my deathless fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I come, said Hesper, not to insult the brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But break thy sceptre and let loose my wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teach the proud stream more peaceful tides to roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And send thee howling to thy stormy pole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That drear dominion shall thy rage confine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This land, these waters and those troops are mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He added not; and now the sable storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierced by strong splendor, burst before his form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His visage stern an awful lustre shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His pearly planet play’d around his head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seized a lofty pine, whose roots of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck deep in earth to guard the sandy shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From hostile ravage of the mining tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rakes with spoils of earth its crumbling side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wrencht it from the soil, and o’er the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirl’d the strong trunk and aim’d a sweeping blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sung through air, but miss’d the moving god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fell wide crashing on the frozen flood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For many a rood the shivering ice it tore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loosed every bark and shook the sounding shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stroke after stroke with doubling force he plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foil’d the hoar fiend and pulverized the tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The baffled tyrant quits the desperate cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Hesper’s heat the river swells and thaws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fleet rolls gently to the Jersey coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And morning splendors greet the landing host.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis here dread Washington, when first the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Trenton beam’d to light his rapid way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pour’d the rude shock on Britain’s vanguard train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And led whole squadrons in his captive chain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where veteran troops to half their numbers yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tread back their steps or press the sanguine field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Princeton plains precipitate their flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through new disasters and unfinisht fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resign their conquests by one sad surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink in their pride and see their rivals rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here dawn’d the daystar of Hesperia’s fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here herald glory first emblazed her name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Delaware’s bank her base of empire stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The work of Washington’s immortal hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prompt at his side while gallant Mercer trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seal’d the firm foundation with his blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In future years, if right the Muse divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some great memorial on this bank shall shine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A column bold its granite shaft shall rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swell o’er the strand and check the passing air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast its broad image on the watery glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Bristol greet the monumental shade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eternal emblem of that gloomy hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the great general left her storm-beat shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tempest, night and his own sword consign’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His country’s fates, the fortunes of mankind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where sealike Lawrence rolling in his pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Ocean’s self disputes the tossing tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From shore to shore, through dim distending skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath full sails imbanded nations rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Britain and Brunswick here their flags unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Hessia’s hordes, for toils of slaughter sold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anspach and Darmstadt swell the hireling train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proud Caledonia crowds the masted main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hibernian kerns and Hanoverian slaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move o’er the decks and darken wide the waves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tall on the boldest bark superior shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A warrior ensign’d with a various crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myrtles and laurels equal honors join’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which arms had purchased and the Muses twined;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sword waved forward, and his ardent eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seem’d sharing empires in the southern sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside him rose a herald to proclaim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His various honors, titles, feats and fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who raised an opening scroll, where proudly shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span><em>Burgoyne and vengeance from the British throne</em>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Champlain receives the congregated host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his husht waves beneath the sails are lost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ticonderoga rears his rocks in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor Edward’s walls the weighty shock sustain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep George’s loaded lake reluctant guides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bounding barges o’er his<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> sacred tides.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>State after state the splendid pomp appals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each town surrenders, every fortress falls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sinclair retires; and with his feeble train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In slow retreat o’er many a fatal plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allures their march; wide moves their furious force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flaming hamlets mark their wasting course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through fortless realms their spreading ranks are wheel’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Mohawk’s wrestern wave, on Bennington’s dread field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last where Hudson, with majestic pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swells at the sight, and checks his rapid race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through dark Stillwater slow and silent moves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flying troops with sullen pause reproves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A few firm bands their starry standard rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheel, front and face the desolating war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sudden the patriot flame each province warms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep danger calls, the freemen quit their farms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seize their tried muskets, name their chiefs to lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endorse their knapsacks and to vengeance speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all the land the kindling ardor flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Troop follows troop, and flags on flags arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Concentred, train’d, their forming files unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swell into squadrons and demand the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Xerxes, raving at his sire’s disgrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pour’d his dark millions on the coast of Thrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er groaning Hellespont his broad bridge hurl’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hew’d ponderous Athos from the trembling world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still’d with his weight of ships the struggling main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bound the billows in his boasted chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide o’er proud Macedon he wheel’d his course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrace, Thebes, Thessalia join’d his furious force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through six torn states his hovering swarms increase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hang tremendous on the skirts of Greece;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep groan the shrines of all her guardian gods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad Pelion shakes, divine Olympus nods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shockt Ossa sheds his hundred hills of snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Tempe swells her murmuring brook below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild in her starts of rage the Pythian shrieks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dodona’s Oak the pangs of nature speaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eleusis quakes through all her mystic caves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And black Trophonius gapes a thousand graves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon the freeborn Greeks to vengeance rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave Sparta springs where first the danger lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her self-devoted Band, in one steel’d mass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plunge in the gorge of death and choke the pass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Athenian youths the unwieldy war to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couch the stiff lance or mount the well arm’d fleet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sweep the encumber’d seas of their vast load</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fat their fields with lakes of Asian blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So leapt our youths to meet the invading hordes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fame fired their courage, freedom edged their swords.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gates in their van, on high-hill’d Bemus rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waved his blue steel and dared the headlong foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Undaunted Lincoln, laboring on his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urged every arm, and gave them hearts to fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starke, at the dexter flank, the onset claims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant Herkimer the left inflames;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bounds exulting to commence the strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And buy the victory with his barter’d life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And why sweet Minstrel, from the harp of fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Withhold so long that once resounding name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chief who steering by the boreal star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er wild Canadia led our infant war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In desperate straits superior powers display’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burgoyne’s dread scourge, Montgomery’s ablest aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ridgefield and Compo saw his valorous might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ill arm’d swains put veteran troops to flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though treason foul hath since absorb’d his soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bade waves of dark oblivion round him roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sunk his proud heart abhorrent and abhorr’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Effaced his memory and defiled his sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet then untarnisht roll’d his conquering car;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then famed and foremost in the ranks of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave Arnold trod; high valor warm’d his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beams of glory play’d around his crest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here toils the chief; whole armies from his eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resume their souls and swift to combat fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Camp’d on a hundred hills, and trencht in form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burgoyne’s long legions view the gathering storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uncounted nations round their general stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wait the signal from his guiding hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canadia crowds her Gallic colons there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ontario’s yelling tribes torment the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild Huron sends his lurking hordes from far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Insidious Mohawk swells the woodland war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scalpers and ax-men rush from Erie’s shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Iroquois augments the war whoop roar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all his ancient troops his train supply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half Europe’s banners waving through the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep squadron’d horse support his endless flanks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And parkt artillery frowns behind the ranks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flusht with the conquest of a thousand fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rich with spoils that all the region yields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They burn with zeal to close the long campaign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crush Columbia on this final plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His fellow chiefs inhale the hero’s flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nerves of his arm and partners in his fame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Phillips, with treasured thunders poised and wheel’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In brazen tubes, prepares to rake the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trench-tops darken with the sable rows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tipt with fire the waving match-rope glows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There gallant Reidesel in German guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Specht and Breyman prompt for action rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His savage hordes the murderous Johnson<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-41" id="noteref-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a> leads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Files through the woods and treads the tangled weeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shuns open combat, teaches where to run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skulk, couch the ambush, aim the hunter’s gun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirl the sly tomahawk, the war whoop sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divide the spoil and pack the scalps they bring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Frazer in quest of glory seeks the field;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>False glare of glory, what hast thou to yield?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How long, deluding phantom, wilt thou blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mislead, debase, unhumanize mankind?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bid the bold youth, his headlong sword who draws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heed not the object nor inquire the cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But seek, adventuring like an errant knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wars not his own, gratuitous in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greet the gored field, then plunging through the fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mow down his men, with stupid pride expire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shed from his closing eyes the finish’d flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask, for all his crimes, a deathless name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when shall solid glory pure and bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone inspire us and our deeds requite?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When shall the applause of men their chiefs pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In just proportion to the good they do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On virtue’s base erect the shrine of fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Define her empire and her code proclaim?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unhappy Frazer! little hast thou weigh’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crirneful cause thy valor comes to aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far from thy native land, thy sire, thy wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love’s lisping race that cling about thy life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy soul beats high, thy thoughts expanding roam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On battles past and laurels yet to come:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas, what laurels? where the lasting gain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pompous funeral on a desert plain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cannon’s roar, the muffled drums proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In one short blast, thy momentary fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some war minister per-hazard reads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In what far field the tool of placemen bleeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Brave Heartly strode in youth’s o’erweening pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Housed in the camp he left his blooming bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweet Lucinda; whom her sire from far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On steeds high bounding o’er the waste of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had guided through the lines and hither led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fateful morn, the plighted chief to wed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He deem’d, deluded sire! the contest o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That routed rebels dared the fight no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And came to mingle, as the tumult ceased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The victor’s triumph with the nuptial feast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They reacht his tent; when now with loud alarms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The morn burst forth and roused the camp to arms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conflicting passions seized the lover’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright honor call’d and bright Lucinda prest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wilt thou leave me for that clangorous call?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traced I these deserts but to see thee fall?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know thy valorous heart, thy zeal that speeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where dangers press and boldest battle bleeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father said blest Hymen here should join</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sacred Love to make Lucinda thine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But other union these dire drums foredoom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dark dead union of the eternal tomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On yonder plain, soon sheeted o’er with blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our nuptial couch shall prove a crimson clod;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there this night thy livid corse must lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll seek it there, and on that bosom die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet go; ’tis duty calls; but o’er thy head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let this white plume its floating foliage spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from the rampart, through the troubled air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These eyes may trace thee toiling in the war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She fixt the feather on his crest above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound with the mystic knot, the knot of love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He parted silent, but in silent prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bade Love and Hymen guard the timorous fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where Saratoga show’d her champaign side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Hudson bathed with still untainted tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The opposing pickets pusht their scouting files,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheel’d, skirmisht, halted, practised all their wiles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each to mislead, insnare, exhaust their foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And court the conquest ere the armies close.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now roll like winged storms the solid lines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clarion thunders and the battle joins;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick flames in vollied flashes load the air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And echoing mountains give the noise of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sulphureous clouds rise reddening round the height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And veil the skies, and wrap the sounding fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon from the skirts of smoke, where thousands toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranks roll away and into light recoil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starke pours upon them in a storm of lead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hosted swains bestrew the field with dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierce with strong bayonets the German reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whelm two battalions in his captive chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bid Baum with wounds enfeebled quit the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Breyman next his gushing lifeblood yield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This Frazer sees, and thither turns his course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bears down before them with Britannia’s force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheels a broad column on the victor flank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And springs to vengeance through the foremost rank.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lincoln, to meet the hero, sweeps the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His ready bands the laboring Starke sustain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Host matching host, the doubtful battle burns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the Britons, now their foes by turns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regain the ground; till Frazer feels the force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a rude grapeshot in his flouncing horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor knew the chief, till struggling from the fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his gored thigh had first received the ball.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sinks expiring on the slippery soil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shock’d at the sight, his baffled troops recoil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Lincoln, pressing with redoubled might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke through their squadrons and confirmed the flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When this brave leader met a stunning blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stopt his progress and avenged the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left the field; but prodigal of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwearied Francis still prolong’d the strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a chance carabine attained his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stretch’d the hero mid the vulgar dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His near companions rush with ardent gait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift to revenge, but soon to share his fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brown, Adams, Coburn, falling side by side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drench the chill sod with all their vital tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Firm on the west bold Herkimer sustains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gather’d shock of all Canadia’s trains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Colons and wildmen post their skulkers there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outflank his pickets and assail his rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive in his distant scouts with hideous blare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And press, on three sides close, the hovering war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Johnson’s own shrieks commence the deafening din,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rouse every ambush and the storm begin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand thickets, through each opening glen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pour forth their hunters to the chase of men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trunks of huge trees and rocks and ravines lend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unnumber’d batteries and their files defend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fire, they squat, they rise, advance and fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yells and groans alternate rend the sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The well aim’d hatchet cleaves the helmless head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mute showers of arrows and loud storms of lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rain thick from hands unseen and sudden fling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A deep confusion through the laboring wing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Herkimer undaunted quits the stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks in loose files his disencumbered band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheels on the howling glens each light arm’d troop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leads himself where Johnson tones his whoop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pours through his copse a well directed fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The semisavage sees his tribes retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then follows through the brush in full horse speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gains the hilltop where the Hurons lead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here turns his courser; when a grateful sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recalls his stragglers and restrains his flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Herkimer no longer now sustains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loss of blood that his faint vitals drains:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ball had pierced him ere he changed his field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slow sure death his prudence had conceal’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till dark derouted foes should yield to flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his firm friends could finish well the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lopt from his horse the hero sinks at last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hurons ken him, and with hallooing blast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shake the vast wilderness; the tribes around</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink with broad ears and swell the rending sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rush back to vengeance with tempestuous might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweep the long slopes from every neighboring height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full on their checkt pursuers; who regain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all their woods, the first contested plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here open fight begins; and sure defeat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had forced that column to a swift retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arnold toiling through the distant smoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld their plight, a small detachment took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bore down behind them with his field-park loud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hail’d his grapeshot through the savage crowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strow’d every copse with dead, and chased afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The affrighted relics from the skirts of war.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on the centre swells the heaviest charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The squares develop and the lines enlarge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Kosciusko’s mantling works conceal’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His batteries mute, but soon to scour the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Morgan with all his marksmen flanks the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hull, Brooks and Courtland in the vanguard glow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here gallant Dearborn leads his light arm’d train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Scammel towers, here Silly shakes the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gates guides the onset with his waving brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assigns their task to each unfolding band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sustains, inspirits, prompts the warrior’s rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now bids the flank and now the front engage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Points the stern riflers where their slugs to pour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tells the unmasking batteries when to roar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here impetuous Powell wheels and veers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His royal guards, his British grenadiers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His Highland broadswords cut their wasting course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horse-artillery whirls its furious force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Specht and Reidesel to battle bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their scattering yagers from each folding wing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here, concentred in tremendous might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Britain’s whole park, descending to the fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roars through the ranks; ’tis Phillips leads the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toils and thunders o’er the shuddering plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Burgoyne, secure of victory, from his height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes the whole field and orders all the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marks where his veterans plunge their fiercest fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where his foes seem halting to retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Already sees the starry staff give way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And British ensigns gaining on the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from the western wing, in steely glare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All conquering Arnold surged the tide of war.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Columbia kindles as her hero comes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her trump’s shrill clangor and her deafening drums</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Redoubling sound the charge; they rage, they burn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hosted Europe trembles in her turn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So when Pelides’ absence checkt her fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All Ilion issued from her guardian gate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her huddling squadrons like a tempest pour’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each man a hero and each dart a sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full on retiring Greece tumultuous fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Greece reluctant seeks her sheltering wall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Peleus’ son rebounding o’er the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Troy backward starts and seeks her towers again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Arnold’s dread falchion with terrific sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolls on the ranks and rules the doubtful day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confounds with one wide sweep the astonisht foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bids at last the scene of slaughter close.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale rout begins, Britannia’s broken train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tread back their steps and scatter from the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To their strong camp precipitate retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wide behind them streams the roaring fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meantime, the skirts of war as Johnson gored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kindred cannibals desert their lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They scour the waste for undistinguisht prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howl through the night the horrors of the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scalp every straggler from all parties stray’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each wounded wanderer through the moonlight glade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while the absent armies give them place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each camp they plunder and each world disgrace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One deed shall tell what fame great Albion draws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From these auxiliars in her barbarous cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lucinda’s fate; the tale, ye nations, hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eternal ages, trace it with a tear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long from the rampart, through the imbattled field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She spied her Heartly where his column wheel’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traced him with steadfast eye and tortured breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That heaved in concert with his dancing crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft, with head advanced and hand outspread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seem’d from her love to ward the flying lead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, dimm’d by distance and the gathering cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last he vanisht in the warrior crowd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She thought he fell; and wild with fearless air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She left the camp to brave the woodland war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made a long circuit, all her friends to shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wander’d wide beneath the falling sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then veering to the field, the pickets past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gain the hillock where she miss’d him last.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fond maid, he rests not there; from finisht fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sought the camp and closed the rear of flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He hurries to his tent;⁠—oh rage! despair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No glimpse, no tidings of the frantic fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that some carmen, as acamp they drove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had seen her coursing for the western grove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faint with fatigue and choked with burning thirst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forth from his friends with bounding leap he burst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vaults o’er the palisade with eyes on flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fills the welkin with Lucinda’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift through the wild wood paths phrenetic springs⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lucind! Lucinda! through the wild wood rings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All night he wanders; barking wolves alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And screaming night-birds answer to his moan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For war had roused them from their savage den;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They scent the field, they snuff the walks of men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fair one too, of every aid forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had raved and wander’d, till officipus morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awaked the Mohawks from their short repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glean the plunder ere their comrades rose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two Mohawks met the maid⁠—historian, hold!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor human nature, must thy shame be told?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where then that proud preeminence of birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy moral sense? the brightest boast of earth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had but the tiger changed his heart for thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could rocks their bowels with that heart combine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy tear had gusht, thy hand relieved her pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And led Lucinda to her lord again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She starts, with eyes upturn’d and fleeting breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their raised axes views her instant death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spreads her white hands to heaven in frantic prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then runs to grasp their knees and crouches there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her hair, half lost along the shrubs she past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolls in loose tangles round her lovely waist;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her kerchief torn betrays the globes of snow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That heave responsive to her weight of woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does all this eloquence suspend the knife?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does no superior bribe contest her life?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There does: the scalps by British gold are paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A long-hair’d scalp adorns that heavenly head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And comes the sacred spoil from friend or foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No marks distinguish, and no man can know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With calculating pause and demon grin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They seize her hands and through her face divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive the descending ax; the shriek she sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Attain’d her lover’s ear; he thither bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the speed his wearied limbs could yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirl’d his keen blade and stretcht upon the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The yelling fiends; who there disputing stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her gory scalp, their horrid prize of blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sunk delirious on her lifeless clay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past, in starts of sense, the dreadful day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Are these thy trophies, Carleton! these the swords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy hand unsheath’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> and gave the savage hordes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy boasted friends, by treaties brought from far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid thy master in his murderous war?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now Britannia’s chief, with proud disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coopt in his camp, demands the field again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to their fate his splendid host he drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swell’d high their rage, and led the charge anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again the batteries roar, the lightnings play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again they fall, again they roll away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now Columbia with rebounding might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foil’d quick their columns, but confined their flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her wings, like fierce tornados, gyring ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crusht their wide flanks and gain’d their flying van;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Arnold charged; the hero storm’d and pour’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand thunders where he turn’d his sword.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No pause, no parley; onward far he fray’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispersed whole squadrons every bound he made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke through their rampart, seized their camp and stores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pluckt the standard from their broken towers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aghast, confounded in the midway field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They drop their arms; the banded nations yield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When sad Burgoyne, in one disastrous day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees future crowns and former wreaths decay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His banners furl’d, his long battalions wheel’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pile their muskets on the battle field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While two pacific armies shade one plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty victors and the captive train.</span>
